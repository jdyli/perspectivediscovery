"Bible-believers hold God’s Word as their absolute authority. There is absolute morality because there’s an absolute authority. And as a result, we believe that abortion kills a human being because each human being is designed in God’s image (Genesis 1:27) and carefully knit together in the mother’s womb by God (Psalm 139:13–16). The Bible makes no distinction between life that’s been born and life that hasn't been. Therefore, murdering an unborn life is just as heinous as murdering a life that has been born.",5,1,"['method', 'creature', 'member', 'condition', 'humanity', 'love', 'new', 'great', 'organ', 'good']",[18],6
Abortion should be illegal God created the earth and us humans And to destroy a precious gift such as a baby that's messed up. Are mother's did not abort use so why should abort our babies those babies have a right like we do like we fight for our rights so let's fight for the rights of those babies. Let's give those babies a chance at life. Like how our mother's gave us a chance at life let's do the same for those babies.,5,1,"['method', 'creature', 'member', 'condition', 'humanity', 'love', 'new', 'great', 'organ', 'good']",[18],6
"There is a distinct separation of those who are for the value of life and those for the destruction of life. It has always been a division of religion. Christianity has always fought and subversively taught that all people have value because they have been given life by God. No other life can extinction another life for its own perceived ends or goals. A mother has no right take the life of her child just as Hilter had no right to take the life of so many. Christianity has always held that women, children, the disabled, the poor and the enslaved have value and therefore should be treated as such by others and the government. It has taken 2,000 years but finally human rights are a concept that is more that just the cry of Christianity, but this is where it started. Here to the advancement of human rights continues. A childs life, whether in the womb or out, is not the toy or possession of the mother. Life is the possession of no other person or being. Such values are not taught by any other study as explained here: http://www.exegeticalstruggles.com/2011/08/religion-is-better-than-science-why.html",0,1,"['none', 'shut', 'chose', 'genocide', 'heard', 'love', 'mentally', 'second', 'understand', 'father']",[18],1
"From a religious point of view, of course abortions are wrong! God commanded man and woman to be fruitful and multiply (in marriage) to populate the earth. Unless I was absent the day of Sunday school or in the 10 years I spent at a Christian school we were taught that God said we could kill an unborn baby for whatever reason, I don't think it's right. 

From a political point of view, abortions are just an easy way out of parenthood. Feminists believe it's their right to get an abortion if they want to since it's ""their body"". Well, what about the baby inside them? They could be a female. Where's her rights? You just took hers away by allowing doctors to vacuum her out of your womb! How DISGUSTING. Also, abortions cause long term effects on a woman's body and mind. Any mother to be always becomes emotionally attached to her child the minute she finds out she's pregnant. Killing her child should be the LAST thing on her mind! Not to mention if she wants to have kids later on in life, she probably won't be able to conceive again bc of her previous abortions. They can affect fertility.

God reserves the right to take someone home, whether that person is 20 weeks in the womb, or 20 years.

"Abortion is murder. You are killing a human being, once it has heartbeat that child is alive. Yes, in certain circumstances such as rape or the fetus being a danger for the mother to live, then that is understanding for a mother to have an abortion, otherwise.. NO! WHY should an unborn child have to suffer because the mother wanted to be not responsible? Even if she did take all precautions to not getting pregnant she STILL knows that there is a possibility of getting pregnant regardless.     Now what I feel they should do is put limit to this. For instance ,   alcohol in some states is illegal if you drink before the age of 21 or the age of 18, but afterwards it becomes legal in cases like this, if a female gets raped or can't hold the child due to medical reasons then NO, she should have the choice to have an abortion. Adoption is always an option though and even if that child is in unloved homes, or foster cares for years, etc. Well , that's God decision to decide how the child's future would be, not yours.

"Why is abortion not considered murder, but if one kills a pregnant woman, they are charged with a double homicide?   Why is it unacceptable for a stranger to kill an unborn baby, but it's acceptable for mothers and doctors to do so? The baby that you are thinking about aborting could be the next Einstein or Beethoven or they could find a cure for cancer.   Children are gifts from God. Even if you cannot provide for the baby, they are plenty of couples that long for a baby, but aren't able to have one. You could put the baby up for adoption and answer someone's prayers",5,1,"['method', 'creature', 'member', 'condition', 'humanity', 'love', 'new', 'great', 'organ', 'good']",[18],6
"A lot of people say that abortion is the only way out of a sticky situation you might get yourself into. Well, it's not. Adoption is ALWAYS an option. Yeah it might be an annoying, aggravating     9 month wait, but if I had the option of weather I would want to bear the guilt of giving a baby up or killing a baby that could of been something amazing, I would definitely choose adoption. When you look at the amount of women abortion saves vs the amount of babies that it prevents from living on this planet, I think it would be worth losing 12 women to save 100,000 babies.   Seriously abortion prevents the life that baby could have! Where would we be today if Benjamin Franklin's mom would of aborted him?   Exactly. There would be no electricity. That baby that you want to abort could be something in this world. Even if you debate weather the fetus is considered a baby or not, do you really want to ruin the chances of a beautiful baby? Think about your life. Think of the thought of never ever being born. Do you mean anything to anyone? Because even if you don't you do to God. If you were never born, that person you mean so much to wouldn't even know you.   Even if   you do t mean something to the world, you do mean the world to someone out there. If are debating weather the term ""murder"" should be used, just go look   the definition up.   It's killing a baby.

A baby is living in the womb and deserves a chance. If your raped give the baby away. Pro-abortionists say that outlawing abortion would restrict a woman’s right to privacy. Is that right absolute?

In the bible in exodus 20: 13 it says you shall not murder. I think it's wrong because it is killing a human being even if it is a fetus . It's still alive because it has a heart beat.

"I believe that abortion is wrong for many reasons but just the tip of the iceberg is that it is just immoral.  It is a proven fact that a fetus has a heartbeat after 5 weeks, around the same time some doctors like to perform them. In the Bible one of God's 10 commandments is ""thou shall not kill"".

"The primary reason abortion is wrong is because God said we are not to murder.   But not all people believe what God says, so let's look at it from a different angle. We are allowed to take life under the prescribed requirements of law, such as self defense, war, execution, etc.   Each of these areas deals with Law.   Self defense is justified because an antagonist is breaking the law (burglary, robbery, assault, etc.), and we can use force to protect ourselves and our property.   War is the legal declaration of hostilities towards another nation.   Execution is the legal taking of life against someone who has committed a crime, or crimes, worthy of execution.   In each case, the antagonists are dealt with for the wrongs they have committed. However, the baby in the womb has done no wrong, yet it is executed.   It is executed but has broken no law!   What crime has been committed?   What law have they broken in their existence?   None.   Yet they are killed. I am reminded of Nazi Germany.   The Jews were guilty of being Jews, and were, according to the Nazis, worthy of death.   Likewise, the babies in the womb are guilty of being babies in the womb, and are, according to the parents, worthy of death.   What laws did they break?   What made them unworthy of life? The answer is simple: it depends on the opinion of those in power, of those wielding the knife and redefining what is life, and of those deciding who is worthy of life and who should die. It is only in abortion that someone is executed but has not violated the law.   This is fundamentally wrong, and this is why abortion is wrong. Since when do we kill someone who's broken no law? Since when do we kill someone who's only ""crime"" was being brought into existence via the copulation of his or her parents?",5,1,"['method', 'creature', 'member', 'condition', 'humanity', 'love', 'new', 'great', 'organ', 'good']",[18],6

A girl should think 1000 times before having sex. I don't understand how decision of having abortion is easy for them.

I know that everyone makes mistakes but don't take your mistakes out on that baby.   You're taking life from a baby growing inside you.

Read C.S Lewis's Matter of Abortion. It is about a demon writing a letter to another demon on how they think abortion is right. 
           In the article, Matter of Abortion, the author proclaims that humans have a right to deny the freedom to life. The reason the author gives us the right is because he feels we have rights over our own body. The author feels if a woman finds out she is pregnant unplanned, and she feels that the baby inside will ruin her chance in life, she automatically decides to deny the life of her own flesh and blood for her own benefit. God’s gift of life is precious. In our selfish world, humans believe they have the liberty to do whatever they please, to please themselves and to make their lives better. People are easily led to believe that they have authority over their own body, to take a life to make their life better, even if it means taking away a precious gift. In the article, Matter of Abortion, the author says:   “With creative cunning, we have corrupted, ‘loving our neighbor as self’ into ‘sparing my neighbor from any discomfort I would want to be spared from.’ Since I would want my daughter spared from the punishment- as one of statesmen have called it- of an unplanned pregnancy, I will not deny my neighbor’s daughter the same relief.”   The goal of abortion is to rid the ‘discomfort’. In the eyes of the devil, “abortion does the cause no good, unless it delivers souls to the nether banquet.” If all their (evil) work succeeds only in the death of the baby, for which the mother later feels remorse and seeks forgiveness, they have failed miserably. What they seek in abortion is not only the death of a baby, but the feeling of the inability for forgiveness. They want her to feel lost, alone and disgraceful. To fulfill the hopelessness of any possibility to be loved again or be forgiven. They want her to be isolated from everything and everyone, especially from God.   But what the devil doesn't understand is that God forgives. He is ultimately, true love. His grace is unconditional, and He forgives.
Acts 13:38 says: Therefore, my friends, I want you to know that through Jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you. Through Christ, our Savior, we can be saved. We can be forgiven through Him. Look at the Apostle Paul. He was murdering Christians for their faith. God confronted him, and Paul repented. He was washed from his sins, through the blood of Christ.

To choose life supports God's will. To choose and support abortion is to choose Satan's will: death.   How is this subject debatable? God is in the creation of each life from conception to birth. Aborting the development of God's creation is, I believe, the worst possible sin. I wrote to President Obama challenging him to discuss this matter. He has been misled to believe a woman has the right to choose to murder God's creation. Ask a child what they say about abortion. Children are innocent and would never say they think terminating a child's chance at life is right in God's eyes. Before we are born we go through a process. That process begins with sexual conception and leads to the process of life. God is in the cells that create life, so when we abort that process we murder God's creation. We as humans have no right ever to stop the process that is created by our creator. I can go on and on, but if it you can't see that abortion is wrong then you are not in touch with creation.

Exodus 21:22-25 prescribes the same penalty—death—for someone who causes the death of a baby in the womb as for someone who commits murder. This clearly indicates that God considers a baby in the womb to be as human as a full-grown adult. For the Christian, abortion is not a matter of a woman’s right to choose.

"An abortion overall is very unnecessary. I get it, Its a women body and she should choose what she wants to do with it, But have we ever stop to consider the other life in that body? It might be her body, But there is also another life inside of her and its not her life to end. For example the minute her doctor announces to her that she is pregnant she doesn't stop and think ""I have 20 fingers"" because why that life is separate from her. So I ask again when does life begin? To the people that think life begins when we are born would that mean you would still abort an eight month old baby in the womb or seven. When would be the time where we decide life starts. For those of you who did not a baby can't start to grow until whats called conception which is when the egg and the sperm meet. Its obvious to me that, Without that a baby can not start to form and that is where life for everyone begins. Have you ever stop to think if being pro-choice even makes sense to you, Or do you just keep using the rape excuse until someone budges? Think what is the opposite of life, Is it not death? Sounds harsh, I know but that's what your covering death with that choice, And what is the final choice to take away the life of the baby. I personally if you can't already tell am pro-life, And I try to hear people out and   see it from another point of view. I thought to myself if I was raped and got pregnant should I abort. My final answer would be no. Why? I would choose not to not just because statistically its a very very low possibility of that happening but because I believe that if god wanted me to be pregnant then so be it. I would love my child because the child wouldn't have been the problem. For those who wouldn't want it, Does it really cost you to let your baby live and put up for adoption instead of paying what thousands for an abortion. Also, To the ones who might have their health be at risk for having a baby, I believe in miracles and they happen everyday no women, No doctor, No man can tell you the final answer only god because whether we like it or not he has the final say, And finally for the ones who would still choose to abort because they made one stupid mistake and don't want to be embarrassed its not the babys fault and you know that very well.",1,1,"['pay', 'stomach', 'pleasure', 'commit', 'foetus', 'good', 'foster', 'deserve', 'love', 'truly']",[18],2

Even if the baby was an ""accident"" he still has a plan. And if you think getting raped and not wanting the baby is an excuse, it shouldn't.

Read C.S Lewis's Matter of Abortion. It is about a demon writing a letter to another demon on how they think abortion is right. 
           In the article, Matter of Abortion, the author proclaims that humans have a right to deny the freedom to life. The reason the author gives us the right is because he feels we have rights over our own body. The author feels if a woman finds out she is pregnant unplanned, and she feels that the baby inside will ruin her chance in life, she automatically decides to deny the life of her own flesh and blood for her own benefit. God’s gift of life is precious. In our selfish world, humans believe they have the liberty to do whatever they please, to please themselves and to make their lives better. People are easily led to believe that they have authority over their own body, to take a life to make their life better, even if it means taking away a precious gift. In the article, Matter of Abortion, the author says:   “With creative cunning, we have corrupted, ‘loving our neighbor as self’ into ‘sparing my neighbor from any discomfort I would want to be spared from.’ Since I would want my daughter spared from the punishment- as one of statesmen have called it- of an unplanned pregnancy, I will not deny my neighbor’s daughter the same relief.”   The goal of abortion is to rid the ‘discomfort’. In the eyes of the devil, “abortion does the cause no good, unless it delivers souls to the nether banquet.” If all their (evil) work succeeds only in the death of the baby, for which the mother later feels remorse and seeks forgiveness, they have failed miserably. What they seek in abortion is not only the death of a baby, but the feeling of the inability for forgiveness. They want her to feel lost, alone and disgraceful. To fulfill the hopelessness of any possibility to be loved again or be forgiven. They want her to be isolated from everything and everyone, especially from God.   But what the devil doesn't understand is that God forgives. He is ultimately, true love. His grace is unconditional, and He forgives.
Acts 13:38 says: Therefore, my friends, I want you to know that through Jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you. Through Christ, our Savior, we can be saved. We can be forgiven through Him. Look at the Apostle Paul. He was murdering Christians for their faith. God confronted him, and Paul repented. He was washed from his sins, through the blood of Christ.

Claiming a zygote (term for the fusion of a sperm and egg- for all of you ""pro-life scientists"" out there) is a human is an idea I find almost silly. Claiming that two cells is life is completely insane. A zygote has no organs, no sensation, etc. 

The boundary for when life begins is hazy, and in that case, I see an argument to when abortion should no longer be legally allowed.

Interestingly enough, the more prevalent sex education and abortions become, we've seen a decline in the number of abortions per year. A 3% decline from 2009, and a 5% decline the year following.

Aside from the facts. There is a poor understanding of when something becomes human. Science cannot give a clear answer, and religion is scattered across the board on the opinion. 

Is it on conception? That doesn't seem to make sense, as millions of sperm and eggs are wasted by bodily functions, or during sex that doesn't lead to pregnancy, either by contraception or simple odds.

Is it when the heart beats? That isn't quite accurate either. We have what we call ""beating heart cadavers"" that aren't considered living.

Brain activity? That's a possibility.

Surviving outside the womb, or independent of the ""life support"" of the mother? Another answer that's possible.

The concept of bodily integrity is an important factor coming into play. Did you know that a deceased person cannot have their organs harvested unless they previously gave permission? With this mindset being so vital, the concept of medical abortions are the same. One cannot be expected to choose another's life over the right to personal autonomy, unless they explicitly agree otherwise.

Yes. It must stay legal. Women can not have bodily autonomy without the option of abortion. Fetuses are not formed enough to know that they are people or that they exist. They are a collection of cells who have not yet formed consciousness. You can't tell someone what they have to do with their organs to save a life. The uterus is no exception.

"Dear MinnesotaWildChild,

My argument is mainly aimed at you as I am absolutely horrified by your statement, not to mention your reference to a 2 year old child being the same as a foetus. A foetus and a 2 year old have completely different abilities and a completely different brain capacity(being that a foetus has none). Can a foetus hold your hand? Can a foetus say I love you? NO. Therefore the fact that you even attempted to compare the two is ridiculous. Now, I am completely aware that there is a point whilst a foetus is developing that they transition from a foetus to a baby, however providing the abortion is before this time there is no reason to suggest the foetus to be considered a baby. 

""That baby was human at the time of birth, which means that it must have been human 5 minutes before the birth. So if the baby is a human before birth, then that means that it is a human while it is a fetus."" < this is a quote from you appalling statement and I think it might have been this part that shocked me the most. Granted a baby is a human 5 minutes before birth, however what about 7 months before this birth was it still a human then? When it did not even have fingers or toes? The answer is NO, it was not , it was just a bunch of cells, no thoughts, no feelings, just cells. A 2 year old on the other hand is a life. It has emotions, a heart, a pulse, a brain, it feels things that a foetus under the age of LEGAL abortion could never feel. Want to know why? BECAUSE IT IS WITHOUT A BRAIN AT THIS STAGE! 

And by the way you snuck in a snide comment about adoption always being another option, but I would like for you to imagine you carrying something for 9 month. You going through all the ups and downs a pregnancy can have, then after going through God knows how many hours of excruciating labour, you holding this tiny, defenceless, innocent baby in your arms and starring into its youthful eyes and feeling that bond and connection that you pray will never be broken. But wait there's an interruption at the door, oh that's right it's the parents you signed your baby off to 7 months ago when it was a still a foetus! What a shame!

Consequently, the inherent preciousness emerges gradually too. For a fertilized egg, there is no consciousness and also no history of consciousness (unless you believe in reincarnation). Even though all the DNA is there, the fact that there's no higher brain activity strongly suggests that there's no consciousness.",1,1,"['pay', 'stomach', 'pleasure', 'commit', 'foetus', 'good', 'foster', 'deserve', 'love', 'truly']",[3],2

So considering that the brain starts developing at around week 5 and its completed at around week 30; and the fact that most abortions are done in the first 6 weeks, would say aborting is not comparable to killing a fully functional human being.

"What is it about a human life that makes it inherently valuable? A very common answer is a person's high sentience, or the ability to perceive. The inherent morality of aborting a fetus or embryo therefore comes from it's ability to perceive. This trait is extremely likely to come from the brain, as it is a human's vessel of thought. In early stages of development (before the brain has developed), abortion is not really murder, as there is likely no sentient person on the receiving end of the action.

An argument cannot be made to compromise a woman's freedom for something that isn't even able to think, even if it is technically a human. It is morally worse to kill an animal for meat than to abort an embryo in its early stages, as it probably perceives more than the embryo.

If abortion is murder then masturbation is genocide because the sperm can be used to make babies? A woman's body, her   choice.   If a fetus was a living person than why do politicians even consider a rape/incest exception.   When they count the population, they do not count a pregnant woman as two people, rather one person. If abortion is murder than why do doctors put the safety of the mother before the child's? The list goes on, but one thing which I've noticed is that most of pro-life claims are based solely on religion, and most of them are men who will never understand what it feels like to be pregnant, who will never understand what challenges women face due to pregnancy.

"A fetus is not human, it has a potential to become one. It is a human in making. One of the most frequent argument that is given by the pro-lifers is that the fetus could have had a proper life. If that's what it makes it wrong enough to be illegal then what do you say about sexual abstinence and contraception? If you did not abstain or had protected sex, you could have given birth to a child. Each time when you use contraception, you deny life to that unborn child who would've taken birth if you hadn't! In this case also a potential human lost its chance to live! Is this tantamount to murder? By extension of the same logic one can say that each second we are not reproducing, we are committing murder. The fallacy of the argument is clear.
In my opinion, abortion should be avoided at all costs but it should be legal. An unwanted baby becomes the source of misery for both the parents and itself.

"The common argument from the pro-lifer crowd is the equating of abortion to the murder of another human being. However, that is simply not the case.

First, murder is the intentional killing of a person. From the Oxford English dictionary, murder is ""the unlawful premeditated killing of one human being by another."" The distinction of human being is important, because it is what distinguishes murder from killing. A person may swat a fly without a second thought, but the killing of another person is abhorrent. Similarly, a person may hunt animals and wild game, yet they would not shoot a person.

What makes murder wrong is that is is the killing of a being that is aware, sentient, and intelligent. Killing a being that is aware of its own existence and mortality is a cruelty that goes unmatched. It is the being's sentience that defines the cruelty, however. A fly or other simple animal has no sentience to speak of, and therefore is not hurt or traumatized through nonexistence.

The fetus in the first trimester is not aware nor does it even have the capabilities of awareness or feeling. How then can abortion be cruel if a fetus cannot possibly be aware of it? By definition, if a fetus is unaware of abortion, then it cannot be cruel. Though the fetus may be alive and human, it is not a person anymore than the cells in my arm are a person.

Conception as a point of personhood makes no sense to me at all. Remember Monty Python's satirical song, ""Every sperm is sacred""? All of the points between conception and birth are far too arbitrary. The fetus is utterly dependent on it's host and the line between fetus and mother is a difficult one to draw. The fetus does not have anything beyond a very rudimentary self awareness, and is certainly not in advance of many animals. Birth is a definitive stage.

Therefore, if it doesn't have a brain, is it truly alive? If it doesn't have a beating heart,   is it truly alive? In my opinion, no, they are not alive, they are just a fertilized cell that hasn't really started growing. #2 Most likely, everyone thinks murder is wrong because the people that die have something to live for or have good memories that should be preserved.

Children never choose to be created and therefore do not deserve such punishments.

If you do not want to have children then do not get pregnant, no excuses. Everyone should know how a baby is made. They do not just fall from the sky. You need to have sex and when you have sex you create a new life. This is what procreation is. Some people say that they do not feel they will be good parents. Well, did you think of this when you were getting down and busy? NO! Having a baby is always a thought that should be running through your head when you are in the heat of the moment. These things do not just happen just because, they happen out of actions. You have to understand that being able to lay down with a man will cost you in some way. I do not want to judge because I am not a saint. However, my thoughts are that you should not be having sex if you do not want to have children. Conception or not. Be mature about sex. It is nothing to play with when it comes to creating a new life. Then there are situations like teen pregnancy, but no one wants to listen when it comes to protection.

Many say that if an individual does not want children, they should be allowed to abort the baby, but that is immoral. Obviously many babies are accidents, but that doesn't mean they don't deserve the chance to live. People in general tend to believe they can do whatever they want without having to deal with the consequences, but that is an not responsible mindset.

If you are willing to make adult decision, it's time to start acting like one. That is what pro-choice should be. If you are willing to engage in sexual activity without protection, you know the HUGE risk of pregnancy will be there. That's what comes along with engaging in sex without protection. Having a child is not a consequence, it is a blessing. And for the record I am against abortion due to morals, not religious beliefs. Abortion in a lot of ways shows irresponsibility, excludes safe sex in the form of being able to prevent pregnancy. Pro abortion people say the following. 1. Just a clump of cells. Well us as humans have how many billion cells? 2. It has the ""potential"" of being a baby. Well, then you are killing potential life. 3. A fetus lacks brain function. Well, so do the mentally retarded and autistic. Should we kill them for lacking brain function? 4. A fetus is a parasite. Well, a human fetus does NOT fit the scientific term for it. I have talked to many biology teachers about this in high school. 4. It is better to abort the fetus than have it belong to a unstable family. I had a unstable family and I am as happy as can be. I don't live the victim lifestyle. 5. Pro-life people do not care about the baby after birth. False. I would adopt any child to prevent it from abortion. Does not matter what color, race, disabled, or anything. Whose body is it really? The mothers, or the fetus's? BOTH. The fetus can not live without the mother. In the cases of rape, incest, or potential health risks to the mother's life, then I am more open.

"I could give a list of reasons explaining how abortion ends a human life. However, That is an old (still unbeaten) argument. So I also approach it like this. Abortion affirms the disease in our culture that is fear of responsibility. People do not want the responsibility of a child because they could not wait until marriage, Graduation, And a solid job. Or they just engage in promiscuous sexual debauchery believing that there will be no consequence for their not responsible actions. 

So what does that breed. A delinquent generation. Abortion affirms freedom of responsibility that manifests itself in fatherless and motherless homes. It also shows up in the form of welfare leeches. It manifests itself in the form of whiny and weeping children that just happen to be 30 years old. 

So what about ""My body"" or ""you're a male you don't understand"". Well first of all, That demeans the child even further by saying my body my choice.

"In my opinion, abortion is immoral. If you had no intention to have a baby or did not want to, you should not have had sexual intercourse. You could have used a condom, birth control pills, or the best tool of them all: abstinence which is the act of restraining one's self. (Condoms and pills might not work sometimes so that's why abstinence is best).
However, the government should not totally ban abortion. There are certain exceptions. For example, a woman who got raped should be allowed to abort. It was not her idea to carry a baby. Also, a person can get an abortion if the baby might kill them. If these are not the cases, other women should not be allowed to abort. If I allowed myself to have sexual intercourse with someone, (even if I am in my teens) I could not surrender myself into an abortion. It was my choice and I have to suffer the consequences.

That's why, in those types of cases I think its only fair to let the women decide. Because if they were raped and they did not have the choice to abort it then it could ruin there lives. But if they have the baby willingly, and were not raped but made a mistake, I think that that women has to step up and take responsibility for it. Women should not be able to have sex willingly but not want a baby, and then find out they are pregnant and just abort it, because then they will just do it again.

If she gets pregnant, this trauma is further exacerbated, especially for those who are younger.

She will relive the rape every time she looks at   her kid, and cannot love him or her as a mother should.

To those who claim there is a reason why women get raped, I agree- they get raped because the rapist can get away with it- so what if a child is born? They don't have to take care of it as the mother has to. The victim is bearing the dire consequences of someone else's actions, when there can and should be a choice if she wants to keep the child.

I come from a single parent household and I see the way that my mother struggles. I feel so sorry for her. I see so many women in this state. Women need to have kids when they are good and ready. And that means hopefully with a husband and a good job to take care of them. Children can grow up damaged from having parents that never wanted them in the first place. Why should a child live with knowing they were unwanted by the people that gave birth to them. This goes for adopted children as well. They will always want to know where they came from and why their parents gave them away. I say avoid all of this pain and get the ,abortion. Let's be honest here, some people should not be parents.

first of all the mother will live the rest of it's life remembering that horrible day, that horrible moment every time she looks at his/her face.

If woman are forced to carry unwanted pregnancies the result is unwanted growing up these children are often disadvantaged or inclined toward brutal behavior to others.

"Abortion is about preventative measures; it's not as simple as 'murder'. Does anyone actually think parents who choose abortion are happy about it? It takes a great deal of forethought and planning to undergo such a drastic procedure; it's emotionally scarring for many people.   The fact is, some people are not meant to be parents (eg: impoverished, teen parents, drug users, etc.) and frankly I would rather have a child not be born at all than have that child grow up in an unstable and unsafe environment. People who choose abortion are not murderers; no, they're people who have ACKNOWLEDGED that they are not fit to be parents. Furthermore, children who grow up in that kind of environment are likely to follow the same shady routes as their parents. I am, of course, happy that I was not aborted; I will admit however, that if my parents weren't the responsible people they were, I would've turned out drastically worse.

And as a sidenote: Remember that you cannot allow images of 'cute little kiddies' to cloud your judgement.

"Let me get this one point across:
A lot of people say so simply ""just give birth to the baby and give it up for adoption."" Sure, put them in an orphanage, living with no parents, with no guarantee of adoption, with no guarantee of living a happy life, with no guarantee of getting a good education. Not all orphans are happy with their lives. Sure, there are some that do live happy lives and people say that at least it gives the baby a chance. Well, I wouldn't want to put my child in that situation and risk it. Also, put yourself in these shoes: you are a 15 year old girl who does well in school and lives a happy life until some effing pedophile rapes you and leaves you with an unwanted baby. Yes, sure tell that poor 15 year old girl who is still in high school to grow her belly and give birth at such a young age. Let her drop out of school. Also, people are saying that some accidentally get pregnant through their own carelessness and so shouldn't kill   a living thing because of their own mistakes. Let me make two points on that. One, you shouldn't let a mistake ruin someone's life. People often make biased judgments about those who make those mistakes. Some may picture them as careless, reckless, whores who bed with many people. I'm not saying all do but it is easy to think of them that way. Why do you think some teenage moms are shamed by people and they are degraded by them. But hey, all humans make mistakes. Some people are genuinely worried and scared for their lives when they find out they are pregnant. They feel immense pressure and regret from their mistake. Secondly, about those who say that the people   shouldn't kill their babies because of their mistakes, you are saying that you should let it live without thinking about what that baby might have to face in the future. Yeah, instead of aborting the still-growing fetus, freeing it from all the suffering it might have to deal with when it grows up, give birth to some accidental baby and dump it in an orphanage cuz hey, it deserves to live.

She dropped out of college, worked a full and part time job, had no money to show for it because she owed her mom (who kicked her out) money, slept on my couch, and had a car that barely ran.   She got pregnant.   Now tell me, someone who isn't mentally stable, switches between different medicine, doesn't have her own room let alone one for a baby, barely has any free time to herself because of work and the free time she does have is spent sleeping between jobs so that she can be awake enough to fulfill the responsibilities at her job, has no money for herself let alone another life (or pay hospital fees for having a child), and does not have any contact at all with the father... Does that sound like someone that should have a child?   If your answer is yes then most likely your plan is rely on the government to give you food stamps and to mooch off of those around you who have money to spare.   Is that what you would want to raise your child to believe is right? That when you can't take care of something yourself that you should rely on other people to do it for you?

Something like that as ""God's plan for a reason""?   I sure as hell know that my best friend did not deserve it and neither did I.   It leaves you feeling so worthless that you don't care if you live anymore, so disgusting that you can't stand your own body anymore, and makes you lose so much faith in humanity.

"Mothers, whether they are in their teens and from a background with poverty or are in their thirties with a strong socioeconomic standing, don't decide to have an abortion simply for the sake of it. That is to say- they typically have a reason for asking for such a procedure to be exercised. Children born into an environment where they're unwanted- whether it be because they cannot be provided for or they are a detriment to their mother or father's future plans- will often not receive proper parenting, and in the case of a large number of people seeking abortions- be born into an adverse environment. Sub-par parenting and harsh conditions lead children to become more likely to become criminals (https://www.Ncjrs.Gov/html/ojjdp/jjjournal_2003_2/page3.Html for those of you who think I'm pulling this out of my rear end).
Furthermore, forced living leaves the child burdened with the ubiquituous sufferings of humanity without the comfort and joy of a mother or father that loves him. This leads to the question of whether all life is sacred, and if having a life at all is ""better"" than not. Now there is no statement of absolute morality which claims that life is sacred save religious scriptures. However, even disregarding the Free Exercise Clause and the separation of church and state, religious scriptures cannot be used as a rational basis for any argument contending that life is sacred, simply for the fact that religion is based on faith. Faith is, by definition, a belief that arises without logical reasoning. Therefore, any person who makes a claim that whatever religion they practice holds all life to be sacred, and as a result of that perceived ""sacredness"" finds abortion to be an abomination is committing the logical fallacy of ""begging the question""- making the unproven assumption that something is true.
Finally, I'd like to redirect this entire contention back to the main idea. ""Is abortion wrong?"" The term ""wrong"" itself implies the implementation of moral philosophy, but there are different ""types"" of morality. However, the form of morality most consistent with reality is consequentialism- where the ends justify the means. The argument from the Pro side (""Pro"" as it applies to debate) is that abortion ends a life. That certainly is bad, but from a moral perspective, that's not always ""wrong"". What would be wrong would be to insist that a woman give birth to a child that she doesn't want in the first place, condemning that child to a future without the exhilaration and comfort of being loved from the very beginning.

(I forgot to mention this as I was typing but a lot of people said adoption was a viable option. Unfortunately, mothers of babies that know that they will be giving their children up for adoption are much more likely to abuse substances during pregnancy.

I don't care about the ""It's a sin of god and murder and you are an attachment to the devil"" or whatever religious bull they say. The simple reason they make abortion into so called murder is that they want the female to have as many children as she can, so she can pass down the religious lies to the next generation, and they can pass it to the next, and so on.

"Yes, abortion is commonly used as a form of contraception. Women use it as a way to get rid of pregnancies that could have been prevented had they chosen other methods of contraception or even not to have sex at all, but that's not the only reason. 
Let's take a look at it this way. Let's say you have a daughter, fourteen, young and beautiful. She has a boyfriend, but they don't do anything because she wants to be safe and she knows she's NOT READY to have a child at that age. Your young daughter is suddenly and unexpectedly raped--by the boyfriend who did not want to wait, someone on the street who saw her and felt he was entitled to doing whatever he wanted to her, or somebody she thought she could trust and evidently could not. However it happened, it happened, and now she has to deal with the consequences. Are you going to tell your fourteen year old daughter that her rape was God's will? Are you going to tell her that it's okay that sex was forced onto her, that she was hurt and violated but the child's life is more important than hers so she's a damn shame and disappointment if she wants to abort it? Are you going to force your CHILD to carry another child inside of her? Any teenager who is pregnant is more than likely exposed to several kinds of bullying and mistreatment for it, because she's seen as a disgusting slut no matter the situation. How is it fair to make a child go through that when the situation is not her fault? How is it fair to put more value in the fetus' life than the life of the female who is already living? Taking the option of abortion away from rape victims, especially teenagers, not only presents them to harsh treatment and scorn from their peers but also takes them away from school and the life they were supposed to be living before the pregnancy. Forcing pregnant females to carry through an unwanted pregnancy takes away from their ability to live their own life, which already exists. Teens drop out of school, are kicked out of homes. Adults can be shamed and scorned in their workplaces for ""getting themselves pregnant."" 
Excuse me? Can a woman get herself pregnant? No, it's not her fault. Why are you placing all the blame on the women? Does anybody pro-life seem to consider the fact that most often men are completely to blame for abortions? Is it a woman's fault when she's been raped? No. Is it a woman's fault when her husband or boyfriend did not want to listen to ""I'm not ready"" or ""I don't want a child"" and chose to do what he wanted? No. Is it a woman's fault when a man she chose to trust impregnated and abandoned her, leaving her to make the decision whether or not to raise a life all on her own?

"I love that almost every argument here for a pro-life advocate is that abortions are a genocide of the young.   However if you ask what should happen to the humans that fight for their religious beliefs across the globe they would say bomb 'em.   So if we are to use the preposition that if a human is doing harm to you be it emotionally (terrorism) or physically than we have the right to protect ourselves from that human.   By the argument given by the pro-lifers is then that an unborn child is a human does the mother not have the same rights to protect themselves from emotional or physical damage.   What they really want to say is the everyone should pay for their bad choices and suffer.   So if a teenager gets pregnant the only way to teach her not to do it again is to force her through a process her emotional development has not prepared her for.   Now to say all women at any age are ready to be responsible for another life seems tenuous at best and brings us back to choice.   Why is it so wrong for someone to not have the government tell them whether or not they can have an abortion.   If the only argument is because they are killing an innocent than Christians need to look at their own history, and how many wars have been fought, how many innocents have died to their ideals.   Pro-lifers have a valid opinion and as that they can believe it, but I can not disprove an opinion, only state facts, and humans die every day to the choices people make.

The bottom line is, people are dying all the time. Laws should not decide what someone wants to do with their own body.

"Okay. I am just going to throw something out there. If you have a two year old, and you sit him/her in the middle of the room, and then you walk out of the room, the toddler does not die. If you take a newborn and do the same, it too survives. If you take an embryo, a zygote, or a young fetus and do the exact same thing, the child dies. Quite often, if you ask someone to tell you why abortion is wrong, they will bring God and religion into the conversation. Not many people have a reason without dragging their deity into the argument. So.....I can understand that abortion is wrong because we are told to value human life above all other life. Why is breaking an eagle egg a felony but abortion not?   Well....Yes.. God said that men have domain over all the other creatures on Earth. I feel that with that responsibility comes a moral obligation to protect those species (especially the endangered ones) (especially especially since men are often the reason other species struggle...E.G. The black rhino). So..What if God wants someone to get an abortion (don't yell ""Blasphemy"" yet), and to help someone grow or alter that person's life, he grants someone with a child that He never means to really live. Maybe He leads people to make the decision of abortion not to be ostracized by an unloving society that claims to be ""Christian,"" but to provide one with an opportunity for some personal growth.

Instead of making the child deal with that pain for 2+ years, it's better to let them go when they do. This project I did changed my perspective on abortion.

It's not about you, its about the mother. Its much more complicated than that as well there's a lot of addition things that goes on with the mother prior and after the procedure. Much more than just saying that the mother is wrong. There is no wrong and right way to live life. There is only choices and consequences. You have no right to tell me how I can live my life or what I can and can not do. You are just a self entitled stranger. 

Stop making everything about you. If you don't want an abortion, than fine, don't, idc. Your choice doesn't affect me, but when you put down females who make this choice, is what pisses me off. Those who never had one will never understand.

I for one have never had a pregnancy scare but I do know that if I was ever raped or if I ever conserved a child in a bad environment I would not look past abortion has an option. No it would not be my first choice but I believe that if the child was going to have a bad life because of my mistakes and my life choice I would not want to bring a human being into that kind of world. I also think that abortion is a hard choice and that needs to be respected. Its not something that anyone takes lightly and when it comes right down to it old men in a conference room should not be the ones making a decision for the entire female population. What would happen if women tried to make such a decision that would impact men that way?

Obviously its different if you were months into the pregnancy it would be but young girls in high school getting pregnant by accident is not, having a child at that young age can be firstly, bad for there body because its not developed properly as they are young and secondly would you rather have child at 15/16?

"For the people reading this, a majority of you will follow a religion where you strongly believe that abortion is simply wrong. That its murder. That the women who choose to end the development of a growing fetus are cruel and heartless. But it's not so black and white.

I have no doubt that at this very moment women all around the world are making the extremely tough decision of having an abortion. Supposedly ""ending"" a life. But how can something that hasn't been born die? Birth is dated from the minute the child is BORN, not conceited.

I believe that women should have a choice. Not only because it's their body, but also because the upbringing of a child is not just an easy 9 month long period with a extremely painful labour, but also every moment after birth. The mothers life does not only belong to them anymore, they have someone else to look after as well as themselves. 

To many, having a child is a great thing. Especially when the person is financially secure, but what about the ones who are not? 

You might be thinking ""well if they are not in the possession of money and can't handle a child they should stop sleeping around"" and yes. You would be right. A small number of abortions do occur due to carelessness but there are other ways a women can burden an un-wanted pregnancy. Rape, the first one coming to my mind. What are some others coming to yours?

Although this topic is controversial, I would like to say abortion is not something most women take lightly. It's not as simple as a few people might think. Women don't just walk into abortion clinics and go ""there's a fetus inside me, let's kill it because I don't feel like one right now"" 

Have any of you ever had that perfect image of how your life would be in the future? Perhaps a beautiful house on the outskirts of the city, a big backyard lush with freshly mowed grass courtesy of your partner, your child playing happily with endless glee.

Is it not possible a women would Rather want this kind of lifestyle (or something in their own perspective) for their child? Is it not possible that it's not just a ""selfish decision "" but a reasonable one that should not be judged? Is it possible that a women could   willingly 'murder' the growing in her body without a second thought? 

I'm not saying it isn't possible, but im trying to show people that... Maybe,   a women is capable of making the decision on whether she can take care and nurture a child after birth, and if she can't she should be able to abort without being judged on her decision.

A women could be in one of many circumstances where she just can't have a kid.

"One word: Choice. Everyone has a choice. If free will exists, then each of us has the right to a choice. Some people have more authority than others. Why? Because past decisions have and will always influence new and upcoming choices. Someone on this planet just decided to rape another. The victim of that rape had unknowingly become pregnant. At the earliest of stages, that woman has a choice: she could let the fetus grow to become a full-fledged human being who would later on in life have the power of choice, or she could remove the fetus while its still not capable of thinking for itself. There are just too many variables to judge what is human and what is not. But for the most part, we know who is human: the rape victim. Are you willing to deprive this adult of her choice just so that a plausible newborn could have theirs? I consider THAT wrong and downright immoral. Abortion, when used properly, will yield the right results that's good for a woman's well-being.

If the woman gives the child up for adoption, there's a chance that they can be put in the wrong family that maybe doesn't accept them. Also what if the woman is too young to care for a child?

So what's worse for a child... sitting in a foster home waiting and wanting love from someone or never existing? Never having to experience the pain of nobody loving them? Call me heartless but i know for a fact that if I got pregnant and i knew I couldn't support it, I would get an abortion... not because I was too lazy and what not, because I would have enough respect to end the babies sorrow and hatred towards me before it even began!",3,1,"['experience', 'machine', 'happiness', 'ok', 'compromise', 'remember', 'okay', 'able', 'support', 'individual']",[2],4
It is not your child and you need to realize that not everyone has your religion. A women has as much right to back out of pregnancy as the man! Some people say it is murder but that's an opinion. Some women are not prepared to go through the second most painful thing possible so everyone who says its wrong needs to shut up.,0,1,"['none', 'shut', 'chose', 'genocide', 'heard', 'love', 'mentally', 'second', 'understand', 'father']",[2],1
"Pregnancy is a natural process that the woman should have complete control over and the ability to terminate if they wish to. 'Pro-lifers' condemn these women and babies to a life of suffering, Authoritatively restricting their ability to do as they wish with their own bodies with the claim that they know the wishes of the baby better than the host of said baby themselves. They have no scientific evidence from which to base their points and cite religion and morals but it is all very not researched and frankly a case of guilt-tripping people into doing very serious.",4,0,"['rapist', 'infant', 'clump', 'hell', 'step', 'gotten', 'fail', 'nervous', 'together', 'unnecessary']",[2],5
Ya abortion is depressing and makes me feel sick but if a girl wants to get one its her choice. Plus maybe there was something wrong and the child was going to have a lot of health problems.. So why would she put herself through that? Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. But bottom line its their body and people don't need to be dictating these girls's   choices.,5,1,"['method', 'creature', 'member', 'condition', 'humanity', 'love', 'new', 'great', 'organ', 'good']",[2],6
"Nobody is saying that everybody should abort every baby that is inside of them so that Thomas Edison, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates.......Etc ins unnecessary, but what is being presented is that a woman should have the right to control what is going in on in her body. I read most of what was said and you guys stated the right of an unborn child, but you guys fail to recognize the rights of the mother. Should the rights of one human be canceled out by a human who is not developed or taken its first breath out the womb? In addition in order to make abortion legal the congress would need to pass a law to make it so. Now congress is made of 80% male. Am I the only person who think that its wrong for a group that is a majority of men to be allowed to dictate and make laws to control what women do with their bodies. Women should be allowed to have a choice in what they do with their bodies",0,1,"['none', 'shut', 'chose', 'genocide', 'heard', 'love', 'mentally', 'second', 'understand', 'father']",[2],1
"Certainly people have to live with the results of bad choices sometimes, but pregnancy is not always the result of bad choices. It is sometimes due to unfortunate events forced upon people. Abortion should be permissible in extreme circumstances, such as in the case of rape, incest or if the mother's life would be endangered by the pregnancy; these are not the result of a woman's poor choice.",,,,[2],
"Pro-life supporters. Have you ever thought about children getting raped? You honestly think that a 9 or a 10 year old is capable mentally and physically first being pregnant because some sicl freak raped the, and then giving birth. They could die. And what do the parents tell her? Oh sweety no we cant abort the baby because some people think its fine for a 10 year old to get raped. And you can forget religion. It has NOTHING to do with this. Just because you believe in av 2000 year old book, should not restrict a woman from abortion. I agree that if a woman has not responsible sex and uses abortion as a way to not get a baby, she shouldn't get an abortion. It was her choice. But if   a woman is very young or raped, she should have a choice.",,,,[2],
"Like the others who say yes, I don't force you to make choices, There are many pros and cons such as getting infertile, You should ALWAYS talk to your family or someone that you trust. And have some time to yourself. If it was accidental but you never wanted a child and you're not capable of caring for it, Either send it to an orphanage or abort. If you turn infertile and you really REALLY want a child, There's always kids at the orphanage waiting for someone. 
Again this is YOUR choice and no one else.
I hope you make it",,,,[2],
"Nervous system function on the level of a functioning organism until about the third trimester. This is also getting near to the point where the fetus could live outside the mother if certain medical procedures and equipment are available. A woman should have the right to terminate her pregnancy as much as she has the right to not allow someone to live in her house and eat her food. While abortion more negative than no pregnancy at all (cost and psychological trauma caused largely by guilt from judgmental people), it should be a woman's right to choose. Abortions, being a negative, should obviously be prevented as much as possible through the use of birth control and safe sex. A woman should be able to make the decision as to whether an abortion is preferable to carrying out the pregnancy, however.",,,,[2],
"No, the law shouldn't have a say in what a woman's choices are to do with her body. Some people aren't ready to be parents and having a child would negatively affect the rest of their life. What if the child was the result of rape or incest? What if having this child affects the mother's health?",,,,[2],
"I as a 15 year old believe that if someone gets raped, is under-aged and has hardly no money to support the baby shouldn't be giving birth. Adoption isn't always an option because there are over 51,000 children are put in for adoption but only little of them are adopted. If you feel like they should be adopted then why don't you adopt them? No? Then stop saying stupid things like that. Most people who give birth to children they don't want to end up being emotionally and physically abusive to the child. If the person is too young to have a child then it could actually kill them while giving birth. If a person is raped and is forced to have the child, it's a constant reminder that their child's father is your rapist. And if the person has no money, then they won't be able to support them with their human needs such as food and hygiene. There is no law saying ""don't have sex if you don't want children"" because it's not always about having a child. It's about having a bond with the person you're in love with. So yeah shut up.",,,,[2],
"A woman should be able to do what they want with their bodies, it is no one else's business. 

Illegalizing abortion is woman are not objects, and we should not be treated like we don't have choices. Countries that have abortion illegalized, also have poor laws regarding females 

Abortion is a freedom, you cannot take away that freedom because that is an act of suppression. 

Females especially should be pro abortion.",,,,[2],
I don't even understand how this is a debate. Abortion is never the best choice. It is murder whether people want to admit this or not. Life begins at conception as the fetus starts to develop immediately and its cells contain HUMAN DNA different from their mothers immediately after conception. Homicide is forcefully ending a life of another human being. A fetus is a human being. Therefore abortion is homicide.,,,,[16],
"The very term ""fetus"" is latin for ""unborn child"". Fancy wording does not change what it is. When an abortion is performed, both child and mother are affected. More women who talk about their abortions claim that they are still haunted by the choice they made. My question for those who support abortion- why is it man-slaughter on two counts when a pregnant woman is killed and the baby dies as a result while abortion is considered a choice?",,,,[16],
"We are not god therefore we don't have the right to kill anyone especially a poor helpless baby. A baby doesn't have to go through scissors and knife because of someone's mistake. ""women should have a choice..Its her body"".. First of all its not just d egg that makes a baby ..Sperm does it too. So its not just the women's choice and second of all its not just a woman's body ..Its 2 bodies. When does a woman has 2 hearts and lungs??? So don't legalise abortion",,,,[16],
Murder is bad for baby and it has no chance   at life. I understand that some babies come from rape and yes that's horrible too but it's an innocent baby that deserves a chance to live it's life. Murder murder murder murder murder no no bad bad bad sin sin,,,,[16],
I hear the argument about the baby not being able to survive on it's own at that time so it doesn't. Well let me ask you this if a family member that has never done anything to you even if you did not have any emotional attachment was in a coma and you knew they would up and healthy in nine months would you still pull the plug? Because you know they are brain dead and can't live on their own so they aren't equal to you right?,,,,[16],
"Abortion should not be legal because then that would mean your taking away another humans life, imagine if your mother did that, you wouldn't be here right now. Just think about it, that baby could have an amazing life.   Even if your a teen you could still birth that baby and then give it up for adoption, at least let the baby have a life.",,,,[16],
"It's wrong, it's super wrong because we were all fetuses at one point, would you find it offensive if someone said i wish you were aborted? Well, i would, everyone no matter age or color of there skin deserves equal rights, and when something has a heart beat, who are we to say it is not human?",,,,[16],
Why kill a innocent child when there are many people out there that can't have children and would love to have one of their own? So every woman should stop and think about the consequences before she lays down in bed. How could you possibly kill something that sweet and innocent just because you don't want to be responsible for something you did?,,,,[16],
"Think of a flower; you plant a seed in the ground, but it is only a seed. That seed will eventually sprout and begin to grow. Would you call a stem with a bud that has not yet bloomed, dead? Is it still considered a flower even though it is not fully grown? In spring, when we see flowers sprouting we still call them flowers. If I went to my mothers garden and snipped all the sprouted flowers off and told her, ""Oh those aren't flowers because they are not fully grown"", she would not be very happy because guess what? Those ARE flowers! As humans, we are constantly changing; constantly developing.   Just because it hasn't developed into something that looks exactly like a human yet doesn't mean its not a human and life.",,,,[16],
Abortion is totally wrong! If your mother had gone and aborted you would you be the happy healthy person you are now? Before cruelly murdering an unborn child please think about the pain and agony this poor baby is undeserving going to go through? What if this baby was you? Think about it.,,,,[16],
"By the time a baby even can BE aborted, pain receptors have already been developed, as well as almost all of the needed organs to survive. It is not a ball of cells, it is a human being. I guess it's just ok to commit genocide these days... Christ help us.",,,,[16],
We humans are killing living things that never had a chance to live.Over 56 million kids have been killed...Why? Because of abortion. That's around 155 babies per hour. So 1 baby every 24 seconds!!! Abortion should be considered as murder and it should be punished as murder. Some babies die by chance but none should die by choice,,,,[16],
"I'm young,yet common sense is what comes to mind when someone say anything about abortion. Common sense is a human is class a human as soon as the sperm penetrates the egg   after that all it needs is its nutrition and oxygen. 
Common sense is murder is murder and war is war. You should never give an excuse to such madness. I could babel on about side affect to the women to show you doesn't benefit them in the long run but stubborn people will always fight back and common sense says all. Those giving excuses are senseless and i feel pity for them, their heart are cold like their common sense.",,,,[16],
"There have been cases where a mother has done a 'self-abortion' and have been charged with murder. What is the difference between 'self-abortion' and regular abortion? The 'fetus' is still being killed. There was also a case where a man had women kidnapped in his home for over 10 years, raping them, and if the woman would get pregnant he would kill the baby. He was also charged with murder. What is the difference between that or abortion? Like I said, the fetus is still getting killed. I think in some cases, such as incest/rape or if the mother is in danger it is okay. But there are so many means of birth control that abortion shouldn't even be needed. If you have ever seen how an abortion is preformed, you can understand how it is murder. They give the baby a shot to kill it (also, the baby can feel pain at that point) and then they pull it out piece by piece. That is inhumane and shouldn't be so so easily accessible.",,,,[16],
"Yes, that is your body but after months that fetus you're trying to kill is a human life. It's ok to have abortions and by doing so killing a being but shooting someone someone is considered horrible ( not saying that killing is ok), you're doing the same thing, except 'that fetus you're killing doesn't have rights' its still has rights.",,,,[16],
If your planning to have an abortion it either there might be a death situation while giving birth or you got raped at a young age. OTHER THAN THAT......That bs if you do it your killing a child .So i suggest if you dont want anythin to do with the child there is some thing called givin for abortion,,,,[16],
"The 'my body my choice' argument is one of the weakest I have ever heard. When you're talking about abortion, you're talking about the destruction of another separate human life. This is another human body, not JUST yours. I could apply the 'my body my choice' argument to me choosing to use my arm to pick up a knife and stab someone in the face because it's my choice to do what I want with my arm. Anyone could see this is a terrible argument, because I'm not just affecting my body.",,,,[16],
Any body out there that is going to get an abortion shame on you because you going to kill a baby for no reason.. And when you kill that baby you are going to be sad because you could of had a baby and took care of it or put it up for adoption,,,,[16],
"The definition of murder is killing a living being; in or outside the womb. It has even been proven that you can feel pain inside of the womb! On that note, it is not only murder, but torturing a poor, developing fetus that everyone once was! Therefore, abortion should be illegal.",,,,[16],
"In the process of abortion, an innocent life is taken and a human being decides for the death of another human being, just because it isn't born yet. This is, by the book, a violation of fundamental human rights, in particular the right to live. Nobody can decide if a person lives or dies.",,,,[16],
The baby starts to develop the organs at 3 weeks and the baby's heart forms at 8 weeks. If you get an abortion then you are considered a murder because that baby can breathe and has a heartbeat so why would you kill the baby? It was the woman and the man's choice to have sex drunk or not it doesn't matter you are still killing an innocent baby.,,,,[16],
Not only are you killing someone but you are killing a baby! That baby should have a life like me or you! Let it see the world! That baby has a purpose because we all are here for a purpose! If you don't want the baby then give it to someone who would love it and care for it as their own! If you was raped for an example that's still not ok to kill the baby! There was a guy who got life for killing a two year old baby! What is the difference there beside the ages? Your killing a baby in both cases but one is ok and the other ain't?! Murder is murder and don't let no one tell you other wise!,,,,[16],
"No matter when you believe a life becomes official, it is still taking the seed that God planted and taking it for granted.   Abortion is murder however you look at it, it is taking an innocent life that could not have had the chance to experience life like everyone should",,,,[16],
There is no reason in the modern world to get an abortion. All the reasons women give for getting an abortion are easily alleviated by giving the child up for adoption. Whenever a humane alternative is available it should be pursued. Women are so dumb in this day and age that they care more for the welfare of dogs and other animals than for losing their unilateral right to murder their own unborn children. Savages.,,,,[16],
"What if the embryo is life? I'm not saying it is or isn't life, but think of what evil the world is doing if they are alive? I'll never be able to understand how people have an abortion, or argue for abortion are   so sure their right. You see, the great thing about being pro life is that even if your right, or wrong, your conscience will be completely clear. If they're not really life, there are no consequences. If they are life, they will be remembered as the ones who tried to save millions of children. However, if someone who is for abortion is wrong, they have to live with that shame and regret for the rest of their lives, and they will always be remembered as the ruthless savages who killed unborn children before they could even utter a plea. The human life is nothing to play with or gamble on. Why take that chance on the life of a little baby?",,,,[16],
"The meaning of abortion, according to the Merriam Webster dictionary, is as follows, ""the deliberate termination of a human pregnancy, most often performed during the first 28 weeks."" One word. Deliberate. Does the child not have rights, too, like the rest of us? You might say that the fetus is not fully developed, but does it not need oxygen, getting it from its mother via the umbilical cord? Of course it does. Fine, you might say an animal needs oxygen too, but I don't think an animal can be born out of a human woman, right? And, doesn't the word, 'termination' stir up something within you, something that sounds like...Murder? A murder ends, which is a   synonym for terminate, a life, and so does an abortion. Face it. What if (and I only said what if) Thomas Edison's mother had decided to abort her baby, then where would we be today? No lightbulb, no electrographic vote recorder, etc,etc... Yeah right, we might as well be back in the stone age. 
All right, the mother might be so ashamed of her unwanted pregnancy she wants an abortion, but too bad, that's the penalty of adultery.
The worst thing is that the mother would have to live with this on her conscience for the rest of her life. You might argue that if the child was born it might be a great burden to society, but I disagree. There are so many couples nowadays who have no children, so wouldn't she be giving a present to the couple the baby is adopted by? 
I hope that mothers will think twice about abortion.",,,,[16],
"Some people may say that abortion isn't technically killing someone because they aren't born yet. Well guess what? That's a horrible excuse. When someone aborts their baby, they are stopping it from being born in the first place. Preventing someone from living is killing them. Women shouldn't be doing things with men if they don't want to have a baby. Really, abortion doesn't make any sense to me, and it never will. It's simply wrong.",,,,[16],
"I believe that in cases of rape, incest, or if the mother's life is in danger, abortions should be allowed. However, if it isn't one of these three cases, then the child should be allowed to live its life. The ""my body my choice"" argument doesn't make much sense to me. It isn't your life, it is your child's life.",,,,[16],
Abortion is the active termination of a innocent human life therefore is completely equivalent of murder. The question isn't whether the fetus has consciousness(as late term abortion argues) its whether it has the capacity to obtain consciousness. The simple fact is that you not being ready to have a baby doesn't negate the consequences of your actions.,,,,[16],
The first thing developed in a baby is its heart. So by getting an abortion you are killing a living child with a beating heart. That is legal but walking out and shooting someone is illegal. So what is the difference? They are both being murdered just by a different way? Your considered a murderer for shooting someone but not my getting an abortion.,,,,[16],
"I have grave doubts about the existence of morality exist.   But if it does exist, then abortion would be murder because a fetus is essentially the same as a premature baby.   Most of us would call it murder if a premature baby was taken out of its incubator.   A premature baby and a fetus are almost exactly the same.   They are at the same developmental stage, have the same level of brain development, organ development, behavior, reflexes, etc.   Almost the only thing different between the two is lung development, which is advanced in a premature baby due to deliberate infusion of corticosteroids into the mother in anticipation of a premature baby.   Therefore, whatever is the moral verdict on allowing a premature baby to die is the same verdict on a fetus at the same gestational age.",,,,[16],
I bet all the NO votes are women who think that its okay to have an abortion. You are all SCUM! And don't deserve to conceive in my honest opinion. You should have been an accident at birth and had your life cut short. At least then you would be cutting others.,,,,[16],
"First of all, I apologize for the grammar mistakes. English is not my best skill.

This is a very complex problem because there is a lot of thing that people consider, women rights, freedom, is abortion safe?, education or career goals, A glob of cells isn't a baby, society forces women to reproduce against their will, A fetus does not have completely developed organs, feelings, or thoughts as a living BABY has.... ETC

But, Do all of those reason have the same importance? We need to simplify... What is the fundamental question? The fundamental question is whether the embryo is a person o not.

If the embryo is not a person, women will decide what they want... Anyone can choose for them, if abortion has risks is their life. Is like jump with a parachute from an airplane. It is their decision.

But if it is a person, that live should be protected.

There are two objective reasons to think that that is a person.

The continuity argument
We need a start up point that everybody agree: ""All of you are people""
A Question: a second before, Were you a person? Yes of course.
And yesterday, Were you a person? Yes of course.
Therefore, Since when you were a person? The exact time, please. 
When you were born? But you were the same that one second before. There was not a qualitative change. What happened at that moment from the embryo point of view? Only that he began to breathe through the lungs. But the embryo was the same one second before. Therefore it is not the point that we are looking for. 

And what about when it was inside the woman. It is a continuous process, so there is any point that it could became from a no-person to a person. Why? Because you can not be a 90% person, or you are a person o you aren't. Or you can be murder or not. There is no intermediate points. A continuous process can not be joint with a discrete process. It is not a solid argument. It is not philosophically coherent.

So, when did you became a person? At the conception. Why? Because you get a new DNA, different from your parents. At that moment, you have defined your sex, your skin colour, your facial features, and a lot of hereditary traits. Is it a enough qualitative change? Of course it is.

I will give you the second argument in other comment.",,,,[16],
"Abortion is murder because you are killing an innocent child and preventing it from coming to meet the beautiful world. Yes, of course women should get the choice of aborting or not, but the one who doesn't get the choice   is the unborn child. People who abort are mostly   18 years or younger just trying to look for an easy way to get rid of something they made.",,,,[16],
"1) a fetus is a life. Glob of cells?   Only a moron would believe that. The fetus has a beating heart. Look at the images of a fetus to get a clue. 

2) an infant or a two year old would die without being taken care of by his mother. Should a baby be murdered then?

3) the argument that "" it's my body"" is so delusional. Am I the same person as my son or daughter?   Is that my heart that's beating???   

4) a fetus is just an earlier stage of life just like a girl is an earlier stage of life as an infant.",,,,[16],
"P1) All innocent human beings have a right to life
P2) A fetus is an innocent human being.
C1) Therefore, A fetus has a right to life
P3) That which infringes on a human being's rights should be prohibited by the Government.
P4) Abortion infringes on the fetus's right to life
C2) Therefore, Abortion should be prohibited by the Government.

Defense of my Premises

P1)
The UDHR and the Constitution would concur with this.

P2)
I would say that it is quite obvious that a fetus is innocent, as it has done nothing immoral. The crux of the premise is whether fetuses are in fact human beings. I believe that an acceptable definition of “Human Being” is “a culture-bearing primate classified in the genus Homo, especially the species H. Sapiens,” as given by Encyclopaedia Britannica.

It is a biological fact that fetuses belong to kind “homo sapiens.” So, by definition, they are human beings. 

C1) Follows from the 2 premise.

P3)
This premiss is echoed by the Declaration of Independence, which says, “that to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men.” 

If the government’s role is to secure rights of its citizens, then obviously, it should outlaw that which infringes on someone’s rights.

P4)
Given that a fetus has a right to life, killing it is obviously infringing upon it’s right to life.

C2) Follows from the previous premisses.",,,,[16],
When you have an abortion on a child you are killing that child before they even see the light of day i think if the mother is not stable enough to have a child she should have her/him then put them up for adoption instead of killing them.Something else if she was raped its not the child's fault don't punish the baby for the actions of another person,,,,[16],
In the mother's womb. The Baby hasn't even done anything wrong and you are deeming it appropriate to kill it. Abortion is basically just a synonym for cold blooded murdering. I HATE ABORTION!!!!! So if you are planning on having an abortion why not just send the poor child to a adoption home.,,,,[16],
Abortion should be illegal because they are not only hurting themselves but they are also hurting a baby that is forming inside their body. Ladies should not do abortion because it was your choice to have relationships with a guy and now you are trying to kill something of life that's not fair.   You are getting away with murder by having a abortion. Killing someone inside of you is more painful. Your going to regret it. Think ABOUT IT .......!!!!!!,,,,[16],
"The case on abortion is always put in the wrong terms. People make the argument of women's rights, which I believe whole hardily in. But in the case of abortion, rights is not the issue. The issue is what is a fetus. Let's look first to the Law of Bio genesis. This says roughly that all species come from the same species. This meaning that a tomato can not come from a potato plant. The same goes for humans. The only thing that humans can conceive are humans. Now let's discuss the differences between a fetus and a newborn. The first difference is size. A fetus is notably smaller than a newborn. But I would ask you if the kind people on Little People Big World are any less of a person than you and I? I think not. Another difference is location. But again, are Italians more human than Americans? Dependability is another difference. The fetuses depend on the mothers. But saying this makes them not human is like saying that people on life support are not human and should just be killed off as well. Now let's talk about rape. One of the largest arguments for abortions is for people who have been raped. But let's look now to my little brother. He is a happy little boy. But let's say that the sight of him stirred up awful memories in my mom's brain. Let's say for the sake of the argument that my mom was raped. In aborting the baby she would have given up all the happy memories as well. All the kisses, all the memories, and all the holidays. But let's say that my neighbor was dating a man who hated the fact that she had kids. So, to get to the man, she killed her kids. Now she could live a happy life with the man of her dreams. But we know that this is wrong. It is murder. So if anyone can give me a solid answer to the belief that fetuses are not humans then I would love to hear it.",,,,[16],
"Because it is as if it were killing my own child but if it is in case of age that is already much greater than in that case, why they start having many children at that age so   this is my opinion about abortion we can stop doing abortion .",,,,[16],
"Murder is illegal and should not be justified because of pressures by society. In the case of rape, it is wrong for one to take something precious from you, just like its wrong to take a precious life from a baby. Abortion is wrong morally, emotionally, and.... In all. God bless.",,,,[16],
"Women and men are killing innocent children before it can take its first breath of AIR. Women want to be in control of their own bodies after they find out they are pregnant. But, when men and women have intercourse with or without protection the outcome can become a child because of the fact the protection can fail.",,,,[16],
Any form of mankind should protect man kind and life wherever possible. It is unfair knowing someone killed a innocent baby from your own mistakes. You are practically murdering a baby so you can live your life but you will always have that guilt of knowing you murdered and took away a little person that is half you. Every baby deserves a chance at life and every mother should give their baby that chance and make it as best as they can for them as the possibly can,,,,[16],
"It is always wrong to take the life of an innocent human. And, who is more innocent then a little baby, not yet born? While some people may want exceptions, does the origin of a human make her less valuable? Nobody should be deprived of their right to life unless they have committed a truly heinous crime such as murder.",,,,[16],
"What is the human fetus? The human fetus is a batch of living cells containing human DNA necessary for the growth of human brain, heart, limbs, bones, and other human features. It's a fact that the fetus is a very early stage of human development. To say that the fetus isn't a human or a person is denying that fact. It's nonsensical to draw that random line and say that a fetus isn't a human within a human female body until birth. That is irrational to say the least. The argument that a fetus isn't a human or it's not murder because it doesn't have thoughts, consciousness, and doesn't feel pain is absurd. The fact is that from the moment a human sperm and human egg meet, a human zygote is formed with the DNA information to grow and develop into a human. Killing the zygote or the fetus make no difference because they both contain human DNA just as a two month old human baby does. It's murder to intentionally the two month old baby so why is it not murder to kill a fetus or a human zygote for that matter? They're all just different stages of human development. It makes no sense to say it's murder at one stage of a human being development but not murder at another stage. In other words, how can it be that something that was never human suddenly become human? It's either a human or it's not.

As for rape, I think this is a very unfortunate case the yields great pain to the victims. It's still murder of the human fetus but the victim shouldn't be held accountable. It's the rapist who has to shoulder the blame for causing an unwanted life form in a woman's body. If they do decide to abort the human fetus because they don't want to be reminded of what happened, it should be done as early as possible.",,,,[16],
"I understand that everyone has their own opinions but what if you were that baby? Everyone deserves a second chance. It might be against my religion, but that has nothing to do with my point of view or my reasoning. A baby is a wonderful gift yeah you may not want or it nothing to do with it, but that baby was for a reason. ""Everything happens for a reason!",,,,[16],
"I'm pro-life for two reasons:

1. Life begins a conception when new DNA is created, Making abortion the killing of a person (AKA murder but legal)

2. I have found many arguments from pro choice don't make sense when I ask questions. Examples:
""It's the women's body"" --- ""Isn't the baby's body? "" 
""It's a form of birth control""   --- ""Is it right at the price of a life? ""
""It's a clump of cells"" --- ""Aren't you a clump of cells? ""
""It's a daily and financial inconvenience to the mother"" --- ""Your 90 year old father is the same thing but why can't you kill him? ""

a many more. . . . .",,,,[16],
"Abortion is murder, you are killing a baby. YOU'RE KILLING YOUR OWN FLESH AND BLOOD. And if you think that's ok then you are a crazy person. You think that's its ok to just kill something that is living inside of you well you need a reality check. YOU ARE CRAZY",,,,[16],
So it's not okay to have the right to execute criminals but it's okay to the right to execute babies. I'm pretty sure babies are far more innocent that criminals. I honestly can't believe how most people are okay with killing a baby but not okay with killing criminals. It goes to show how deranged society has become.,,,,[16],
"Abortions moral state boils down to is the Fetus a human being? If it is not a human being, than it still has the potential to be a human being. If it is, then over fifty million people in the US alone have been murdered in cold blood. Do you want to take even the smallest chance of voting for something that has killed over ten times as many as the holocaust?",,,,[16],
"Yes, it's wrong.  It's wrong to take the life of an innocent human being.  Abortion takes the life of an innocent human being.  Therefore, abortion is wrong.  It really is as simple as that.  And it's silly to suggest the unborn are anything but human beings.  They have human DNA, their parents are human, and if they aren't killed, they will go through every stage of human development--embryo, fetus, infant, child, adolescent, adult.",,,,[16],
"God made us who we are. Can you imagine an innocent baby being in so much pain. If the man and women wanted sex, they better accept the fact that they created a beautiful soul within. Indeed, those who murder babies are either scared or just cruel. In short, it isn't the baby's fault ever...And they deserve to LIVE.",,,,[16],
Abortion is wrong because its not right i think that there should be a law that says no abortion in this state because it is wrong to kill child its the same as killing a person like 28 years old so it does not make sense to abort a baby,,,,[16],
"How would you like it if someone aborted your sister/baby/brother/mother/father/etc? Its a horrible thing and you will have to answer to the lord, if you have an abortion then you have more problems wrong with you than Obama! You are sick in the head and should go to bloody hell for your thoughts.",,,,[16],
"That's why practically every ""pro-choice"" supporter thinks that abortion is ok. About 40 years ago, LIFE magazine posted in one of their issues that at the moment of conception, a new life is present, and at that point, it will always be morally wrong to abort the child. That's why abortion even in cases of rape are intrinsically wrong, because the baby or the ""problem"" might be gone, but the girl's experience is not. If a girl is raped, but doesn't get pregnant, she still has to live with that moment.",,,,[16],
"I think abortion is pure MURDER! Imagine a woman who cannot carry a baby. Now imagine a woman who was raped or ""accidentally"" got pregnant, she decided to abort the baby. Now, the other woman could have raised that baby to become a successful person. Think about it, plenty of women would LOVE to have a child, but can't. Think about all the doctors, or fire people, or business people that could have been born! Maybe later in life he/she could have found the cure to cancer!
What I'm saying is we humans are supposed to embrace life not crush it. We have the ability to make the world a better safer place. 
From what my mom tells me, being a mother is pure joy! So let's spread it!",,,,[16],
"Abortion should not be your choice, it is murder. The definition of murder is the unlawful premeditated killing of one human being by another. If you commit abortion you are taking away a baby's life. It is not just was catholics should believe it is what humans should believe. Make your choice heaven or hell.",,,,[16],
"People who are getting an abortion are killing a human (a child, in fact). Who cares if the baby doesn't have a conscious, it is wrong to kill anything, even if it doesn't understand that it's dying. Saying ""why care what a women wants do to with her body"" has an exception. If the women is killing someone with her body, then we should care. It's like saying, ""why care if the man kills that kid over there"" Killing is wrong no matter what! By the way, killing in war is different from abortion. Abortion is because someone wasn't ready for a baby and war is because of conflict. Even if it was an ""accident"", give the baby up for adoption instead. I'd rather be separated from my parents for a while than dead.",,,,[16],
"Killing however causes a life to risk. So, there is no option whether it is small or large. Size doesn't matter. However it is a life. We should not kill a life just for the sake of our enjoyments. We still have many things that can be used to prevent birth. So, Abortion should be punished.",,,,[16],
"Abortion takes away life of newborn babies who are completely innocent. So parents who do the abortion actually kill people in real and take away babies' lives without their consent and agreement. Every lives should be granted the right to life but not arbitrarily taken by their parents. So abortion, such behaviours should not be encouraged and legalized.",,,,[16],
Imagine if you were the one being killed what were you gonna do that is breaking the rule of killing people and i think that since you will be busy aborting wont you be scared to be dead even if you were raped maybe it was God's plan that child will be a blessing to you and dont you think that maybe one day you will also die and meet those innocent babies you have killed i dont have much to say but please try to figure out this and you shall see that God will do something great for you,,,,[16],
"It wouldn't be fair for the baby to be aborted when it doesn't even have a say in whether or not it's fair for it to not get a chance at life and to have a childhood and grow up without being killed before even being born. It's unethical to think that you being born is okay but for some reason that child can't be allowed to live. If you don't want the baby or just can't afford it, at least give it up for adoption. Anything is better than taking away its only chance at life. If you were to literally put yourself in the same position as the baby, you'd understand how unfair it would be for you if you were never loved and aborted by your own mother who never wanted you.",,,,[16],
"Look at abortion this way guys. Is killing a random person on the street considered a ""civil law""? No. So killing someone that did not ask to be in this world is VERY cruel!!! What if YOU were aborted? You wouldn't even be able to type right now! Be happy you weren't",,,,[16],
"If a human being, at 8 weeks, already with a heartbeat, brainwaves, finger print and the ability to feel pain is not qualified as life, what is the difference between you and the baby?   If bacteria on mars is life and motivates many scientist and organizations, why isn't a baby?",,,,[16],
"Abortion is murder because its a baby like the rest of us that where babies that came out of our mothers stomach. Your mother would have gotten an abortion on any of yous. All of us deserve to live. Were all living beings that god created. The children have a right to live. It doesn't matter what religion your in, but babies deserve to live!",,,,[16],
"A living being has been created at this point , on your watch, mind you. You are doing nothing short of killing it. If you had unwanted a child to begin with, you can choose to use protection or flat out   do not have sex. That is an option.",,,,[16],
"Abortion should be illegal because it is basically killing a human being no matter how old or   how far you are with the baby, If you give the example of not wanting the child to be depressed that it is adopted then that would be like taking your dog behind your house and shooting it because you don't want it.",,,,[16],
"Pro-Choice Liberal logic: You can't afford a baby, or you don't want to give birth, or it might be born into a bad family, so you can kill it.
That is freaking retarded. That makes no sense at all. The only circumstance I agree with abortion is when the mother is 1OO%, definitely going to die if she has to give birth. Don't you dare give me some crap of how it's 'not even an alive human yet' or it's 'just a fetus, not a baby.' Because come on. How often do you hear a pregnant woman say, ""I love my fetus.""? Tell me honestly. How often? The answer is never. I'm all for women having rights but I draw the line when someone else is being harmed.",,,,[16],
"I do not believe abortion is okay. If is essentially a form of murder. There is only one person who has the right to take the life of anybody, who all know who that is..The great almighty.   The fact that partial birth abortion is still going on today makes me sick to my stomach. Should be banned!!",,,,[16],
"Why is it different to kill a baby once they are born versus in the womb? So confused why our society thinks it is everyone's right but no one's responsibility. Yes you have the right, the right to not have intercourse, but your child also has the right to not be KILLED",,,,[16],
"Now many of you, upon seeing my name in this column, will assume I am taking away a woman's right to choose. Think of it as giving a child his or her's Right to Life back. 56 million babies have been aborted since Roe v Wade 40 years ago. That is a number Hitler would be proud of. We know we are on the wrong side of an issue when we've killed more babies than Hitler killed Jews. We have an American Genocide going on right beneath our noses, and I will do everything in my power to save the sacred life of an unborn child. When your child has been in the womb 22 days, they have the gift of life, a heart beat. Think of the days they have ahead of them, walking, playing and laughing. Who has the right to take away that life? Not a mother. If a pregnant woman is murdered, the suspect is indicted for a double murder, so the government does recognize that the child is alive. Our government endorses the American Genocide by funding Planned Parenthood, an organization founded by Margaret Sanger, a racist who wanted to destroy minorities through sterilization and abortion. Her goal is being achieved and it is a sad day when we have to tolerate these mass murders. You democrats may not realize it, but their is a higher authority than the federal government, and one day we have to answer to him, how do you explain to God letting 56 million children die?",,,,[16],
"Having an abortion is murdering a child! You're killing an innocent human being. By the time most women find out that they are pregnant, their baby's heart is already beating. People say women deserve to choose whether to have an abortion or not, but what about the child that hasn't started life yet? They don't get a choice.",,,,[16],
"Some people who try to justify abortion say that it's not murder because it's legal, It will decrease poverty, Or that it will only lead to unsafe abortions. But there was one point in which slavery was legal. And if you want to eliminate poverty so bad, Then why are you so opposed to programs to helping the poor. And just because people will have illegal abortions is still no justification for legalizing it. For example, Prostitution is illegal and widely visible yet there is no movement towards legalizing it.",,,,[16],
"For some reason people need high and lofty reasons not to kill children.   Maybe I'm just a dreamer, but a world where children are not ripped apart in the womb and killed in the very place that should be safest seems like a decent place.   Maybe I'm just a crazy idealist.",,,,[16],
Abortion is killing a baby (which is murder!!! Which is illegal!!!). You think it's okay to kill an unborn baby but it's not okay to abuse and kill a ten year old... And you have two other options instead of that. Option one; you could not get pregnant . Option two you could give the baby to a family that cannot have kids!!!,,,,[16],
"Pregnancy is a miracle.       Most wonderful thing that a person can do in this world is giving life.     What achievement can top that?     When you grow old and near end of your life journey, and reflect back on your life, would the fact that you led a successful career have more meaning than knowing that your flesh and blood, your gene, your belief will carry on after your time is up in this world?",,,,[16],
"There are many ways why abortion is wrong. First, why is it illegal in the United States to harm eagles eggs? You get fined of $2,000. And yet when you kill a baby inside the womb, it's not considered illegal?   That's stupid! It is legal to abort a baby within nine weeks. But the stupid thing is that a nine weeks old baby is already pretty much developed. When you abort, you murder. When you abort, one heart stops, another heart breaks. (Pro life)   I'm honestly tired of democrats! I'm sorry.",,,,[16],
"When a woman has an abortion she is killing her very own child, an innocent, voiceless, fragile life. It should not be just the mother's choice to keep a child alive or not. The baby within weeks is already so alive and has so many features, and by a month has organs! This should be made illegal.",,,,[16],
"Everyone who is alive today was once a fetus in the womb. Why do you have the right to live now if you did not then? It is still you. Every abortion ends a life. Last I checked, choosing ending the life of another was called murder. Choosing to end the lives of a lot of people is called genocide.",,,,[16],
"Their is a baby waiting to be born to live a healthy and full life. Another life shouldn't be killed because one did not use protection, its your own fault. In cases of rape, THEIR IS SUCH THING AS GIVING BIRTH AND PUTTING IT UP FOR ADOPTION. YOU ALL ARE MURDERERS IF YOU DO ABORTIONS",,,,[16],
"If one believes in inalienable rights then abortion can only be murder.   Inalienable means that the rights are neither gained nor lost, but an intrinsic characteristic.   The same organism cannot therefore gain or lose an inalienable right.

Since murder is fundamentally a violation of the fundamental right to life, and we recognize inalienable rights, there is no conclusion other than abortion is murder.",,,,[16],
"As stated before, abortion is murder. A fetus, like a human, has a pumping heart, eyes, organs, a brain, etc. etc. What doesn't make it a child (human being), that all matters to the person, although everyone has their own preferences. Yes, abortion is wrong, why must it be debated at all?",,,,[16],
"Why is everyone agreeing that it is right to kill someone that hasn't even take their first breath. If it's wrong to kill a random stranger, then it should be wrong to kill your own flesh and blood your mini you. It's just plain wrong. You wouldn't be alive right now.",,,,[16],
"Women want to have complete control of their body and of the direction that their lives are going to go. Say that the woman wants to further her career and doesn't want their pregnancy and child to affect their life plan. However, if they truly want control of their body and the direction of their life, they can try this thing called abstinence. Sex is meant for reproduction. The reason that there is pleasure in it, it so people will want to do it, resulting in more people. This is common science. If you are not ready to have a baby, then you are not ready for sex. Just because one has done something that messes up their life plan, the life of their child and their future should not be aborted. Everyone deserves a chance to live, so don't allow someone's mistake kill an innocent person. That is the most selfish thing anyone can do.",,,,[16],
Even though a fetus is not yet an actual baby it is still a growing creation of life and it deserves to have a chance to live before it is judged. I really want abortions to stop for the better of humanity. For the better of nature itself. Please help.,,,,[16],
"Abortion is the choice of a mother. To murder. The heart beats at 24 weeks; it can feel pain even earlier. Over 50 million babies have been killed since Roe vs. Wade. Its shameful to think that we are worse than the Nazis who killed 6 million Jews. Some people even say that its fine to kill the baby, that a mother's inconvenience is more important than a babies life. Shameful.",,,,[16],
"Abortion is just murder. Unborn infants do not have a voice yet, so that means we need to be able to speak for them. They are defenseless so we need to help defend their rights because they are humans and it is going against the 14th amendment, they deserve life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness just like everyone else in America. They are not the victim, they need our voices to help protect them.",,,,[16],
"Abortion is bad because it denied a child rights to life and under the human rights law, every child have the right to life so why abuse such rights when you were given yours at the time of your birth? Lets give every child their rights no to it!!!1 k",,,,[16],
"If human rights apply to every human then how can they not apply to a human embryo/fetus which is inarguably human.   I believe in women's rights but not when they take away the rights of another. I hear the clump of cells argument all the time but you can't discriminate against someone for their age,race,gender,disability why should you be able to take away the rights and discriminate against a completely separate human that at their stage in life are different. There is no question a fetus is alive, no question it is human they just can't fight for their rights which is why we need to. I believe in a woman's right to choose multiple forms of birth control or abstinence not murder.",,,,[16],
"Abortion is wrong because your killing a person inside you and they were able to have a chance to live but if you get an abortion your just killing a person like as if it is nothing and if your 16 and your pregnant and your parents tell you to get an abortion just say "" imagine if i was you and this baby   was me and your parents tell you to abortion me what would you do?",,,,[16],
"People say that abortion is acceptable because a few cells is not a baby. That is not the case. If that were truly the case, truly the way we believed, then we would not consider bacteria and protozoa alive- among other things. I believe in the sanctity of life- not because I'm a Christian, but because I am human. Every human has infinite potential. We should not take away their life to live, their ability to experience the joys of falling in love and raising a child, just because the parents don't think they are ready. Instead of committing murder to take care of unplanned pregnancy we should be faithful to our current-future spouses and not indulge our every whim.",,,,[16],
Abortion should not be legal cause your killing your own child before its born. If you don't want your child just give it up for adoption. There's people out there who want kids and cant have any so why kill a kid when you can give it up to adopting. Its their fault for spreading their legs,,,,[16],
"Bacteria on Mars is classified as life, yet a tiny, fully developed baby is not classed as life? What gives this potential parent or parents the right to choose if this life gets to live or die? Its done to suit their lifestyles. Its inhumane and selfish. I rest my case.",,,,[16],
"You would never kill your child if it was in the world (at least I would think that you wouldn't) but you will kill it when it is becoming a beautiful baby. If that sweet, harmless baby   could talk, it would say that it would want to live. Seriously, think about the baby, not you.",,,,[16],
"Should it be considered a human right after it's born? Of course. How about right before it's born? Well, yes, certainly. How about several minutes before the baby is born? It's still human, is it not? The fact of the matter is that, no matter how far back we go in the baby's progress -- even if we went to the point that it was a single cell -- by killing it you are ending the life that could be. No, not could be. Would be.",,,,[16],
"Even though it may be debated a fetus isn't a person and therefore has no rights, it is not a debate on whether or not the fetus is a living organism. The fetus is alive and, like other animals that are living and not human, should have rights that protect their lives from any individual who wishes them dead for any selfish means.",,,,[16],
"Life starts at the moment of conception, a completely unchangeable fact. A babies organs begin forming at 3 weeks and there is a heart beat at eight weeks. No person should have the right to take another's life, just because it cant speak or express itself does not mean anything, its still a Human being! Its not you're choice; if you were the baby, would you like to be the one being killed?",,,,[16],
"It is a baby, and you are murdering it. It is not the women's body, considering they are killing another person's body. You don't get right to decide on whether a child get's to live or not, before it has even gotten the chance to prove it's self worth in the world.",,,,[16],
It is murder because if your alive then of course the baby is alive. If the mother was dead than more than likely the baby is dead. The baby is copying the mother really. It doesn't matter if the baby is still in the mothers womb it is murder. A baby is a baby. Whether the baby is a little sperm cell and almost 9 months into pregnancy. The baby is 100% alive.,,,,[16],
