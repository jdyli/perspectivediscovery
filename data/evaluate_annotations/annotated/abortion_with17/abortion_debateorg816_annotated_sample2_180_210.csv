The baby may technically be alive but it isn't sentient until 24 weeks of pregnancy by which abortion would be illegal in most places. So if you abort a baby it wouldn't feel anything so it wouldn't suffer anything. It may grow up to be a an incredible inspiration but if the parent wanted it aborted and didn't abort it they would likely send it to an orphanage where chances of being adopted are crazy low. In fact according to https://skywardjourney.wordpress.com/orphan-statistics/ 70 percent of male orphans who age out (which is pretty likely if they aren't adopted young) end up being hardened criminals. The source also states that 60 percent of females who age out become prostitutes.
