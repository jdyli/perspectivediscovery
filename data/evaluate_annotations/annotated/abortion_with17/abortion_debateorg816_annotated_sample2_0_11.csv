Yeah, I said it.

Why?

""You have the right to do whatever you want as long as you do not violate another person's right to do whatever they want.""

The fetus is violating the woman's right to bodily autonomy. Contrary to popular opinion, sex is NOT CONSENT TO PREGNANCY. It just isn't. So get that through your thick heads.

If the woman consents, then all is well. If the woman does NOT consent, then abortion is her only option.

Also, if you are pathetic enough to use pregnancy as a punishment for people who have sex, then you don't deserve to live in polite society.

That said, I do not believe that fetuses are ""persons"". I am pro-choice very simply because the right to bodily autonomy is the most important right in the world, period. Women have that right, and deserve to exercise that right at ALL TIMES, period.

I am also not a woman and will never get pregnant.

915,1582734815-1677,https://www.debate.org/opinions/is-abortion-wrong,"First of all, I apologize for the grammar mistakes. English is not my best skill.

This is a very complex problem because there is a lot of thing that people consider, women rights, freedom, is abortion safe?, education or career goals, A glob of cells isn't a baby, society forces women to reproduce against their will, A fetus does not have completely developed organs, feelings, or thoughts as a living BABY has.... ETC

But, Do all of those reason have the same importance? We need to simplify... What is the fundamental question? The fundamental question is whether the embryo is a person o not.

If the embryo is not a person, women will decide what they want... Anyone can choose for them, if abortion has risks is their life. Is like jump with a parachute from an airplane. It is their decision.

But if it is a person, that live should be protected.

There are two objective reasons to think that that is a person.

The continuity argument
We need a start up point that everybody agree: ""All of you are people""
A Question: a second before, Were you a person? Yes of course.
And yesterday, Were you a person? Yes of course.
Therefore, Since when you were a person? The exact time, please. 
When you were born? But you were the same that one second before. There was not a qualitative change. What happened at that moment from the embryo point of view? Only that he began to breathe through the lungs. But the embryo was the same one second before. Therefore it is not the point that we are looking for. 

And what about when it was inside the woman. It is a continuous process, so there is any point that it could became from a no-person to a person. Why? Because you can not be a 90% person, or you are a person o you aren't. Or you can be murder or not. There is no intermediate points. A continuous process can not be joint with a discrete process. It is not a solid argument. It is not philosophically coherent.

So, when did you became a person? At the conception. Why? Because you get a new DNA, different from your parents. At that moment, you have defined your sex, your skin colour, your facial features, and a lot of hereditary traits. Is it a enough qualitative change? Of course it is.

I will give you the second argument in other comment.",The fundamental question and objectives arguments,against,[17]
