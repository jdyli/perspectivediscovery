Even the bible seems to head in this direction, ""Let a woman learn quietly with all submissiveness. I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; rather, she is to remain quiet. For Adam was formed first, then Eve; and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor. Yet she will be saved through childbearingâ€”if they continue in faith and love and holiness, with self-control."" - Timothy 2: 11-5. Thanks God! Now I know I need to bear children and be submissive in order to enter thy holy kingdom! Awesome! So for all those people who think ""Women are murders if they abort because life is equal and unique,"" remember, a fetus isn't an excuse to force a young woman with free will and passions into young, unprepared parenthood. Religious answers opposing legalization has it's downsides, such as how most religions see women as objects and those who believe all life is sacred, especially an unborn fetus in the body of a woman who may be at fault or not (considering rape), you might as be forcing the young girl to throw away all of her freedom. Humans can adapt, yes, but that is not an excuse to limit a woman's freedom. And about self control, don't say that to any person's face. You nor I are 'God' or Kevin Bacon for that matter and she has the choice to 'self control' herself.

That just reminds you all the time of the trauma the victim went through, and it's not fair. 

Now I want to address the ''use protection'' argument. Contraception is never 100% effective. Even if you use a condom, an IUD, and take the morning after pill after you have sex there is still a chance of getting pregnant. It's very small, but still there. And a person should have he right to have sex for pleasure and/or emotional bonding without wanting children. 

And by using the logic that aborting an embryo or a fetus which has the potential to become a life is murder, millions of men and women globally are homicidal maniacs, including me and you. Because egg cells have the potential to become a human life, yet they are killed off every month. And men would have it worse. Their sperm cells die constantly, and each of those sperm cells has the potential to become a human life. Therefore, in order to prevent killing possible lives, we must find a way to preserve sperm cells and women must not have periods.

Many say that if an individual does not want children, they should be allowed to abort the baby, but that is immoral. Obviously many babies are accidents, but that doesn't mean they don't deserve the chance to live. People in general tend to believe they can do whatever they want without having to deal with the consequences, but that is an irresponsible mindset.
