It is the woman that has to carry the fetus in her womb for up to nine months and definitely change her lifestyle to make sure the baby receives proper nutrients. Pregnancy changes a woman's life immediately and often unexpectedly. The woman does all the hard work during pregnancy; therefore, it should be the right of that woman to decide if she is ready to bring another life into this world. If she decides that she is not ready, she should have the option of terminating her pregnancy. If a woman is raped, and doesn't want the baby, she should be able to have an abortion. Also, what if someone got unintentionally pregnant and was not financially ready? Or maybe the couple was underage and didn't have the experience?
