Adoption is ALWAYS an option. Yeah it might be an annoying, aggravating     9 month wait, but if I had the option of weather I would want to bear the guilt of giving a baby up or killing a baby that could of been something amazing, I would definitely choose adoption. When you look at the amount of women abortion saves vs the amount of babies that it prevents from living on this planet, I think it would be worth losing 12 women to save 100,000 babies.   Seriously abortion prevents the life that baby could have! Where would we be today if Benjamin Franklin's mom would of aborted him?   Exactly. There would be no electricity. That baby that you want to abort could be something in this world. Even if you debate weather the fetus is considered a baby or not, do you really want to ruin the chances of a beautiful baby? Think about your life. Think of the thought of never ever being born. Do you mean anything to anyone? Because even if you don't you do to God. If you were never born, that person you mean so much to wouldn't even know you.   Even if   you do t mean something to the world, you do mean the world to someone out there. If are debating weather the term ""murder"" should be used, just go look   the definition up.   It's killing a baby.

564,1582734700-1076,https://www.debate.org/opinions/should-abortion-be-illegal,"1) Murder is illegal.

Murder is the “unlawful killing of a human being” with some level of intent. California law includes “a deliberate intention unlawfully to take away the life of a fellow creature.”

stopabortion6The only thing preventing abortion from being included in the definition of murder is that it’s currently not “unlawful.” But basic science proves that an unborn child is a “human being.” No mention of “personhood” is necessary for basic murder definitions. Killing a “human being” or a “fellow creature,” even, is enough.

Why, as a society, do we pick and choose human beings whom we can deliberately kill? These human beings are fully human, entirely innocent, and helpless and voiceless. Yet we purposely target them, setting very few restrictions on their killings.

Is there any other class of human beings that our society will make it “lawful” to kill? Belgium is already on the path to extending legal murder through its legalization of euthanasia – even child euthanasia. History shows that Nazi Germany, once it began to legalize the murder of human beings, simply continued down the path – the elderly, the sick, the disabled, gypsies, homosexuals, the Jews, those who defended the Jews. Where would it have stopped?

This is why abortion must be illegal if murder is illegal. It should never be “lawful” to kill any innocent human being.

As for abortion it should stay legal as there are far worse things the mother could do to herself to kill the unborn fetus.
