Let me ask you if a man's heart stops beating, should a firefighter try and resuscitate the man? After all, the man is dead, correct? No.
Someone is confirmed dead when they have no more brain activity. Which is exactly why when someones' heart stops, they try and get it pumping again because they are not dead yet.
Another example of this would be someone in a coma. They feel nothing, taste nothing, and can't even BREATHE on their own. Therefore, they are technically not alive, however not dead either because they are being supported. Without that support, however, they would be dead. That is why euthanasia exists.
