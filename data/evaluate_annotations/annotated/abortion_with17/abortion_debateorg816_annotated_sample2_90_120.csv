But once you are pregnant, you have the moral responsibility to protect that baby against all cost and against all peril and complications. That baby is yours and religion aside and moral relativism aside, it is homicide to kill another human being and the same can be said about foetuses. Moreover, I know that there are women how get pregnant from rape. This is very unfortunate obviously but I do believe that these women should separate the baby from the rapist.

Religion is no more than an opinionated belief system, held by oneself, that is not allowed (by law) to be rationale for public policy.

Beyond religious opinions and fictional statements such as ""life begins at conception,"" I am curious as to if there even is a valid, scientific argument that supports the notion of pro-life. I haven't seem to have found one yet.

Claiming a zygote (term for the fusion of a sperm and egg- for all of you ""pro-life scientists"" out there) is a human is an idea I find almost silly. Claiming that two cells is life is completely insane. A zygote has no organs, no sensation, etc. 

The boundary for when life begins is hazy, and in that case, I see an argument to when abortion should no longer be legally allowed. However, there is a definite period of time in which organs have yet to develop, sensation and neural processing has yet to occur, etc, in which abortion is medically supported to be legal. You cannot medically support ""god"" or your religious beliefs.
