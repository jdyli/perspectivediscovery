However, there is a way to lower the amount of abortions that happen without the mother risking her life at a backstreet abortion clinic, or Terrorists and Extremist organizations such as the Army of God killing innocent people such as women, the baby, and men in favor of abortion.

The reason I voted to make abortion legal is I have though of a system. This is only hypothetical, but what if there was a law where before a woman can get on abortion, she has to go to a counsellor. I mean anger and fear can cloud the mind and make us do things we don't want or mean to do, right? Therefore, what if a woman doesn't want an abortion? What if she is just scared, wants to fix her problem and thinks that there is no other option. Well that's where the counsellor comes in. The woman can tell the counsellor about her situation and the counsellor can give her options and tell her (based on her situation) what the best option is. For example, with a situation like rape, a woman is usually scared and wants an abortion. However, if she goes to a counsellor, the counsellor can help her to realize that she has other options such as adoption and that she may not have to abort. The illegal part is not getting the abortion, the illegal part is not going to the counsellor to see otherwise. However, if a woman still feels that she wants an abortion, she should be able to get one. It's her decision and NOT to be rude, but her fault if something goes wrong or she changes her mind too late.

By using this system, women can make more sober minded thoughts and can use other options besides abortion.
