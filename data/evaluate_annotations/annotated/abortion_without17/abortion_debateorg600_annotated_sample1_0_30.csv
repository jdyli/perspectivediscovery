First off, every person who has some common sense knows that when you have sex a consequence may be pregnancy, and legalising abortion basically is making it ok for anyone to do what ever they want without being responsible for their actions and dealing with the consequences.
Obviously there are circumstances of rape and in that case have the baby and then give it up for adoption as many couples would love and appreciate the child more than you would.
The fetus is a life from the second it is conceived. A 50 year old women is just as much a life as a 2 second old fetus, so if murdering a 50 year old is illegal then so should murdering a fetus be.
I completely agree with women having the right to do what ever they want to do with their body but in this situation it is affecting a life that could turn out to be amazing.
Some of these pro- abortion arguments are BS. Like the one 'a child should not spend its life knowing its mother is stuck with it' and 'a constant reminder to the mother about the rape. Obviously the mother would have given it up for adoption if she knew she couldn't love it.

I think what talking points really matter here is whether it causes suffering to sentient beings and what it contributes to the world. 

So, does it cause suffering? Well, if you listen to the folks who shout that it's murder and then carry on explaining everything in explicit detail, then I guess it does. But, you know, speaking as the guy who brings up '56 billion' on virtually every single topic I visit, I can honestly say that I never have to resort to going too much in detail how animals suffer when I try and make my points and there's no reason for me to accept that these people who utilize appeal to emotion are credible.

Sorry, but if both sides claim something that's factually conflicting, I'm going with the one that doesn't have fundamentalist loonies which have done a lot to destroy their credibility with me.

Now, does abortion contribute anything to the world? Well, this whole notion of 'women being able to do what they want with their body' is a nice little sentiment, but if it causes suffering I honestly don't think someones sense of entitlement permits them to do 'whatever they want' simply because they happen to be a human being. So, if this being were to feel pain, I think we'd need a more legitimate reason.

Oh wait, I got one. Well, I mean, I've got a more legitimate reason than why all of you folks eat your hamburgers and your omelets do anyway -   because abortion is a legitimate means to reduce our massive population of 7.7 billion people. This reasoning goes far beyond selfish whims, appeals to emotion and these ultimately pointless notions of humanity.

Read C.S Lewis's Matter of Abortion. It is about a demon writing a letter to another demon on how they think abortion is right. 
           In the article, Matter of Abortion, the author proclaims that humans have a right to deny the freedom to life. The reason the author gives us the right is because he feels we have rights over our own body. The author feels if a woman finds out she is pregnant unplanned, and she feels that the baby inside will ruin her chance in life, she automatically decides to deny the life of her own flesh and blood for her own benefit. God’s gift of life is precious. In our selfish world, humans believe they have the liberty to do whatever they please, to please themselves and to make their lives better. People are easily led to believe that they have authority over their own body, to take a life to make their life better, even if it means taking away a precious gift. In the article, Matter of Abortion, the author says:   “With creative cunning, we have corrupted, ‘loving our neighbor as self’ into ‘sparing my neighbor from any discomfort I would want to be spared from.’ Since I would want my daughter spared from the punishment- as one of statesmen have called it- of an unplanned pregnancy, I will not deny my neighbor’s daughter the same relief.”   The goal of abortion is to rid the ‘discomfort’. In the eyes of the devil, “abortion does the cause no good, unless it delivers souls to the nether banquet.” If all their (evil) work succeeds only in the death of the baby, for which the mother later feels remorse and seeks forgiveness, they have failed miserably. What they seek in abortion is not only the death of a baby, but the feeling of the inability for forgiveness. They want her to feel lost, alone and disgraceful. To fulfill the hopelessness of any possibility to be loved again or be forgiven. They want her to be isolated from everything and everyone, especially from God.   But what the devil doesn't understand is that God forgives. He is ultimately, true love. His grace is unconditional, and He forgives.
Acts 13:38 says: Therefore, my friends, I want you to know that through Jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you. Through Christ, our Savior, we can be saved. We can be forgiven through Him. Look at the Apostle Paul. He was murdering Christians for their faith. God confronted him, and Paul repented. He was washed from his sins, through the blood of Christ.

2. You can't kill someone just because it is convenient to you.
