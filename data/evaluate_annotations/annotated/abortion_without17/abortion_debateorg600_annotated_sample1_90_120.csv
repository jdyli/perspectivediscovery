Abortion is not something that should be played with because you are playing with a life. If you do not want to have children then do not get pregnant, no excuses. Everyone should know how a baby is made. They do not just fall from the sky. You need to have sex and when you have sex you create a new life. This is what procreation is. Some people say that they do not feel they will be good parents. Well, did you think of this when you were getting down and busy? NO! Having a baby is always a thought that should be running through your head when you are in the heat of the moment. These things do not just happen just because, they happen out of actions. You have to understand that being able to lay down with a man will cost you in some way. I do not want to judge because I am not a saint. However, my thoughts are that you should not be having sex if you do not want to have children. Conception or not. Be mature about sex. It is nothing to play with when it comes to creating a new life. Then there are situations like teen pregnancy, but no one wants to listen when it comes to protection. They just are not mature or responsible when it comes to having sex. They do not tell their children what they should be doing in order to abstain from having a child that they are not mentally, emotionally, physically, financially or spiritually ready to take care of.",Abortion is selfish,against,[25]

2) You're killing a PERSON, not a brainless fetus. As a farmer I can tell you, when a chicken egg is fertilized, it's thought of as a future chick. It's the same thing here; yes, it's not completely developed but neither is the chicken growing inside the egg.

3) Where's the baby's choice? And don't give me that ""it can't know what's happening."" Can I ask you what you remember as a little infant? No much, I can tell you. Well, it's the same concept here. Should parents be able to murder their infants because they wouldn't know what's going on? A sane person would say no.

4) It affects every pregnancy after the abortion. Did you know that most women who had an abortion want children later in life? Yeah, abortion makes future conception just that much harder for the now wanting mother.

5) If you're willing to get a surgery that kills babies, maybe you should instead be thinking about a safer alternate. Tying your tubes will prevent a baby from forming, and a abortion wouldn't be needed. And if you want a baby later, you have the choice to reverse the surgery. However, abortion can't be reversed. Once the baby's dead, it's dead.

9) Rape. If I personally got raped, and I can honestly tell you this: I would want the baby. My logic; to have gone through something so terrible but to receive such a gift, it'd be the consolation prize. I've never been one for souvenirs because they never remind me of a place I've been, so there always rendered pointless. But that's the thing; I would never focus on who the child's father is.

In cases of rape, the victim already suffers significant trauma. If she gets pregnant, this trauma is further exacerbated, especially for those who are younger. If abortion is rendered illegal even in this case, the mother will never be able to look at her baby in the same way as any other child. She will relive the rape every time she looks at   her kid, and cannot love him or her as a mother should. Think about the consequences for both the mother and the kid- feelings of abandonment and agitation. To those who claim there is a reason why women get raped, I agree- they get raped because the rapist can get away with it- so what if a child is born? They don't have to take care of it as the mother has to. The victim is bearing the dire consequences of someone else's actions, when there can and should be a choice if she wants to keep the child.
