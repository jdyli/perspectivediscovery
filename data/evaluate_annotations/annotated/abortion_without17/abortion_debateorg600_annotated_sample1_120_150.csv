Well, as a women I can tell you that no, if anything you are for women is you are against abortion. Actually you are for life and humans in general if you are pro-lifers. People say that the ""thing"" inside women when they are pregnant is not a child. They call the baby a ""thing"" because they know that once they acknowledge that the life inside a women's womb is in fact a baby, their argument is gone. Killing an innocent life is wrong. Period. You can try to spin it in whatever way you want to but the truth is it is wrong. Even worse is that life cannot speak or do anything to defend itself. Women who are confused and scared during their early pregnancy weeks are told by many people, such as the employees at planned parenthood, that its okay to go through with an abortion because it is their ""choice"". They leave out the part of the trauma that a mother experiences after she has gone through with the abortion and realizes that she ""chose"" to murder her own child. The statement, ""Pro choice is prow omen"" is false in . I would like to direct this next point to all people who are debating which side they want to take, pro life or pro choice. If you have children, think to yourself, would you want someone to try to justify killing them? For those who don't have children, look at all the people in your life, if their mother decided to have an abortion would you be the same person without that particular person?

I would say yes. This is because a child (from a newborn to around a 10 year old) is an entirely dependent being. They depend on a parental figure to survive. This means that they are subject to that which they depend on because they do not have a choice in the matter. In other words, they lack the power to be self sustaining thus they are entirely dependent on the willingness of others to keep them alive. In my opinion I would also venture to say that infanticide (while there are much better options for the child) is even permissible depending on the context.",Abortion is the ending of a life.,for,[2]

Let me ask you if a man's heart stops beating, should a firefighter try and resuscitate the man? After all, the man is dead, correct? No.
Someone is confirmed dead when they have no more brain activity. Which is exactly why when someones' heart stops, they try and get it pumping again because they are not dead yet.
Another example of this would be someone in a coma. They feel nothing, taste nothing, and can't even BREATHE on their own. Therefore, they are technically not alive, however not dead either because they are being supported. Without that support, however, they would be dead. That is why euthanasia exists.
The ""baby"" in the woman's womb is not alive within the legal time that abortions are available at regular abortion clinics. Therefore, it should be legal. Especially since the person who is alive should have full access to do what they want with their body. No one has the right to tell another what to do with their body.

Murder is the “unlawful killing of a human being” with some level of intent. California law includes “a deliberate intention unlawfully to take away the life of a fellow creature.”

stop abortion The only thing preventing abortion from being included in the definition of murder is that it’s currently not “unlawful.” But basic science proves that an unborn child is a “human being.” No mention of “personhood” is necessary for basic murder definitions. Killing a “human being” or a “fellow creature,” even, is enough.

Why, as a society, do we pick and choose human beings whom we can deliberately kill? These human beings are fully human, entirely innocent, and helpless and voiceless. Yet we purposely target them, setting very few restrictions on their killings.

Is there any other class of human beings that our society will make it “lawful” to kill? Belgium is already on the path to extending legal murder through its legalization of euthanasia – even child euthanasia. History shows that Nazi Germany, once it began to legalize the murder of human beings, simply continued down the path – the elderly, the sick, the disabled, gypsies, homosexuals, the Jews, those who defended the Jews. Where would it have stopped?

This is why abortion must be illegal if murder is illegal. It should never be “lawful” to kill any innocent human being.
