First off, every person who has some common sense knows that when you have sex a consequence may be pregnancy, and legalising abortion basically is making it ok for anyone to do what ever they want without being responsible for their actions and dealing with the consequences.
Obviously there are circumstances of rape and in that case have the baby and then give it up for adoption as many couples would love and appreciate the child more than you would.
The fetus is a life from the second it is conceived. A 50 year old women is just as much a life as a 2 second old fetus, so if murdering a 50 year old is illegal then so should murdering a fetus be.
I completely agree with women having the right to do what ever they want to do with their body but in this situation it is affecting a life that could turn out to be amazing.
Some of these pro- abortion arguments are BS. Like the one 'a child should not spend its life knowing its mother is stuck with it' and 'a constant reminder to the mother about the rape. Obviously the mother would have given it up for adoption if she knew she couldn't love it.

I think what talking points really matter here is whether it causes suffering to sentient beings and what it contributes to the world. 

So, does it cause suffering? Well, if you listen to the folks who shout that it's murder and then carry on explaining everything in explicit detail, then I guess it does. But, you know, speaking as the guy who brings up '56 billion' on virtually every single topic I visit, I can honestly say that I never have to resort to going too much in detail how animals suffer when I try and make my points and there's no reason for me to accept that these people who utilize appeal to emotion are credible.

Sorry, but if both sides claim something that's factually conflicting, I'm going with the one that doesn't have fundamentalist loonies which have done a lot to destroy their credibility with me.

Now, does abortion contribute anything to the world? Well, this whole notion of 'women being able to do what they want with their body' is a nice little sentiment, but if it causes suffering I honestly don't think someones sense of entitlement permits them to do 'whatever they want' simply because they happen to be a human being. So, if this being were to feel pain, I think we'd need a more legitimate reason.

Oh wait, I got one. Well, I mean, I've got a more legitimate reason than why all of you folks eat your hamburgers and your omelets do anyway -   because abortion is a legitimate means to reduce our massive population of 7.7 billion people. This reasoning goes far beyond selfish whims, appeals to emotion and these ultimately pointless notions of humanity.

Read C.S Lewis's Matter of Abortion. It is about a demon writing a letter to another demon on how they think abortion is right. 
           In the article, Matter of Abortion, the author proclaims that humans have a right to deny the freedom to life. The reason the author gives us the right is because he feels we have rights over our own body. The author feels if a woman finds out she is pregnant unplanned, and she feels that the baby inside will ruin her chance in life, she automatically decides to deny the life of her own flesh and blood for her own benefit. God’s gift of life is precious. In our selfish world, humans believe they have the liberty to do whatever they please, to please themselves and to make their lives better. People are easily led to believe that they have authority over their own body, to take a life to make their life better, even if it means taking away a precious gift. In the article, Matter of Abortion, the author says:   “With creative cunning, we have corrupted, ‘loving our neighbor as self’ into ‘sparing my neighbor from any discomfort I would want to be spared from.’ Since I would want my daughter spared from the punishment- as one of statesmen have called it- of an unplanned pregnancy, I will not deny my neighbor’s daughter the same relief.”   The goal of abortion is to rid the ‘discomfort’. In the eyes of the devil, “abortion does the cause no good, unless it delivers souls to the nether banquet.” If all their (evil) work succeeds only in the death of the baby, for which the mother later feels remorse and seeks forgiveness, they have failed miserably. What they seek in abortion is not only the death of a baby, but the feeling of the inability for forgiveness. They want her to feel lost, alone and disgraceful. To fulfill the hopelessness of any possibility to be loved again or be forgiven. They want her to be isolated from everything and everyone, especially from God.   But what the devil doesn't understand is that God forgives. He is ultimately, true love. His grace is unconditional, and He forgives.
Acts 13:38 says: Therefore, my friends, I want you to know that through Jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you. Through Christ, our Savior, we can be saved. We can be forgiven through Him. Look at the Apostle Paul. He was murdering Christians for their faith. God confronted him, and Paul repented. He was washed from his sins, through the blood of Christ.

They never prove that a fetus is not a human, and instead put out ridiculous claims like if it can't think, then it is not a human. These are rebutted as such:
1. A baby is not a woman's body. Jingram claims this is because fetuses can't think. However, if this logic was true, wouldn't that means that shooting up an insane asylum woulds be morally okay.
2. You can't kill someone just because it is convenient to you.
3. The claim here is that consciousness and memory make something human. If you follow this reasoning through, you would see that this means people with alzheimers don't count as human, something no one would agree with.

Abortion is not something that should be played with because you are playing with a life. If you do not want to have children then do not get pregnant, no excuses. Everyone should know how a baby is made. They do not just fall from the sky. You need to have sex and when you have sex you create a new life. This is what procreation is. Some people say that they do not feel they will be good parents. Well, did you think of this when you were getting down and busy? NO! Having a baby is always a thought that should be running through your head when you are in the heat of the moment. These things do not just happen just because, they happen out of actions. You have to understand that being able to lay down with a man will cost you in some way. I do not want to judge because I am not a saint. However, my thoughts are that you should not be having sex if you do not want to have children. Conception or not. Be mature about sex. It is nothing to play with when it comes to creating a new life. Then there are situations like teen pregnancy, but no one wants to listen when it comes to protection.

2) You're killing a PERSON, not a brainless fetus. As a farmer I can tell you, when a chicken egg is fertilized, it's thought of as a future chick. It's the same thing here; yes, it's not completely developed but neither is the chicken growing inside the egg.

3) Where's the baby's choice? And don't give me that ""it can't know what's happening."" Can I ask you what you remember as a little infant? No much, I can tell you. Well, it's the same concept here. Should parents be able to murder their infants because they wouldn't know what's going on? A sane person would say no.

4) It affects every pregnancy after the abortion. Did you know that most women who had an abortion want children later in life? Yeah, abortion makes future conception just that much harder for the now wanting mother.

5) If you're willing to get a surgery that kills babies, maybe you should instead be thinking about a safer alternate. Tying your tubes will prevent a baby from forming, and a abortion wouldn't be needed. And if you want a baby later, you have the choice to reverse the surgery. However, abortion can't be reversed. Once the baby's dead, it's dead.

To those who claim there is a reason why women get raped, I agree- they get raped because the rapist can get away with it- so what if a child is born?

Murder is the “unlawful killing of a human being” with some level of intent. California law includes “a deliberate intention unlawfully to take away the life of a fellow creature.”

stop abortion The only thing preventing abortion from being included in the definition of murder is that it’s currently not “unlawful.” But basic science proves that an unborn child is a “human being.” No mention of “personhood” is necessary for basic murder definitions. Killing a “human being” or a “fellow creature,” even, is enough.

Why, as a society, do we pick and choose human beings whom we can deliberately kill? These human beings are fully human, entirely innocent, and helpless and voiceless. Yet we purposely target them, setting very few restrictions on their killings.

Is there any other class of human beings that our society will make it “lawful” to kill? Belgium is already on the path to extending legal murder through its legalization of euthanasia – even child euthanasia. History shows that Nazi Germany, once it began to legalize the murder of human beings, simply continued down the path – the elderly, the sick, the disabled, gypsies, homosexuals, the Jews, those who defended the Jews. Where would it have stopped?

This is why abortion must be illegal if murder is illegal. It should never be “lawful” to kill any innocent human being.

However, there is a way to lower the amount of abortions that happen without the mother risking her life at a backstreet abortion clinic, or Terrorists and Extremist organizations such as the Army of God killing innocent people such as women, the baby, and men in favor of abortion.

The reason I voted to make abortion legal is I have though of a system. This is only hypothetical, but what if there was a law where before a woman can get on abortion, she has to go to a counsellor. I mean anger and fear can cloud the mind and make us do things we don't want or mean to do, right? Therefore, what if a woman doesn't want an abortion? What if she is just scared, wants to fix her problem and thinks that there is no other option. Well that's where the counsellor comes in. The woman can tell the counsellor about her situation and the counsellor can give her options and tell her (based on her situation) what the best option is. For example, with a situation like rape, a woman is usually scared and wants an abortion. However, if she goes to a counsellor, the counsellor can help her to realize that she has other options such as adoption and that she may not have to abort. The illegal part is not getting the abortion, the illegal part is not going to the counsellor to see otherwise. However, if a woman still feels that she wants an abortion, she should be able to get one. It's her decision and NOT to be rude, but her fault if something goes wrong or she changes her mind too late.

By using this system, women can make more sober minded thoughts and can use other options besides abortion.

Note what Josephus, in his histories of the Jews, states concerning abortion, ""The law orders all the offspring to be brought up, and forbids woman either to cause abortion or to make away with the fetus, a woman convicted of this is regarded as an infanticide because she destroys a soul and diminishes the race."" 

The United States is a country where 5,500 abortion clinics abort 30% of all pregnancies. In our nation's capital there are three abortions performed for every one live birth, and this is not uncommon. Since 1980 abortions have outnumbered live births in 18 metropolitan areas of the United States. The shame of this problem is reflected in the statistic that 99% of all abortions are performed on demand. This means that the only prerequisite that is demanded of the mother is her desire to rid herself of the developing fetus. For years we have heard the cry that if abortions were abolished, ""What would happen to the woman who finds herself in the position of having been raped, involved in incest, has a severe fetal deformity, or her life is at stake?"" The way this argument is presented leads one to believe that abortions are here because of such cases. However, let us not blind you with the facts! Only 1% of the abortions performed annually in this country are for rape, incest, fetal deformity, or the mother's health. Many believe that the percentage is even smaller than this. Let us note a fact concerning pregnancy in the case of rape or incest. ""The case of rape and incest is really a non-issue because of its rare occurrence. It is estimated that in 5,000 to 10,000 rapes, only one pregnancy will result. In a typical US city with a population of 500,000 that would be one case every 10 to 20 years!""

 There are at least five major procedures that are used to terminate an unwanted pregnancy. (1) The vacuum suction method. ""The vacuum is so powerful that the baby is instantly broken up into a fluid mass of blood, tissue, and cartilage."" (2) The cutting up method. ""The doctor just slices the baby into pieces inside the womb of the mother. The skull is crushed with the concepts to reduce its size for the withdrawal."" (3) The surgical method. ""The abdomen of the mother is surgically opened and the baby removed. The baby is then either used in experiments or else burned or drowned in water."" (4) The Saline Method. ""A salt solution is injected into her amniotic sac where the baby is literally burned to death -in effect pickling the baby.

That its murder. That the women who choose to end the development of a growing fetus are cruel and heartless. But it's not so black and white.

I have no doubt that at this very moment women all around the world are making the extremely tough decision of having an abortion. Supposedly ""ending"" a life. But how can something that hasn't been born die? Birth is dated from the minute the child is BORN, not conceited.

I believe that women should have a choice. Not only because it's their body, but also because the upbringing of a child is not just an easy 9 month long period with a extremely painful labour, but also every moment after birth. The mothers life does not only belong to them anymore, they have someone else to look after as well as themselves. 

To many, having a child is a great thing. Especially when the person is financially secure, but what about the ones who are not? 

You might be thinking ""well if they are not in the possession of money and can't handle a child they should stop sleeping around"" and yes. You would be right. A small number of abortions do occur due to carelessness but there are other ways a women can burden an un-wanted pregnancy. Rape, the first one coming to my mind. What are some others coming to yours?

Although this topic is controversial, I would like to say abortion is not something most women take lightly. It's not as simple as a few people might think. Women don't just walk into abortion clinics and go ""there's a fetus inside me, let's kill it because I don't feel like one right now"" 

Have any of you ever had that perfect image of how your life would be in the future? Perhaps a beautiful house on the outskirts of the city, a big backyard lush with freshly mowed grass courtesy of your partner, your child playing happily with endless glee.

Is it not possible a women would Rather want this kind of lifestyle (or something in their own perspective) for their child? Is it not possible that it's not just a ""selfish decision "" but a reasonable one that should not be judged? Is it possible that a women could   willingly 'murder' the growing in her body without a second thought? 

I'm not saying it isn't possible, but im trying to show people that... Maybe,   a women is capable of making the decision on wether she can take care and nurture a child after birth, and if she can't she should be able to abort without being judged on her decision.
