The mothers life does not only belong to them anymore, they have someone else to look after as well as themselves. 

To many, having a child is a great thing. Especially when the person is financially secure, but what about the ones who are not? 

You might be thinking ""well if they are not in the possession of money and can't handle a child they should stop sleeping around"" and yes. You would be right. A small number of abortions do occur due to carelessness but there are other ways a women can burden an un-wanted pregnancy. Rape, the first one coming to my mind. What are some others coming to yours?

Although this topic is controversial, I would like to say abortion is not something most women take lightly. It's not as simple as a few people might think. Women don't just walk into abortion clinics and go ""there's a fetus inside me, let's kill it because I don't feel like one right now"" 

Have any of you ever had that perfect image of how your life would be in the future? Perhaps a beautiful house on the outskirts of the city, a big backyard lush with freshly mowed grass courtesy of your partner, your child playing happily with endless glee.

Is it not possible a women would Rather want this kind of lifestyle (or something in their own perspective) for their child? Is it not possible that it's not just a ""selfish decision "" but a reasonable one that should not be judged? Is it possible that a women could   willingly 'murder' the growing in her body without a second thought? 

I'm not saying it isn't possible, but im trying to show people that... Maybe,   a women is capable of making the decision on wether she can take care and nurture a child after birth, and if she can't she should be able to abort without being judged on her decision.

I think what talking points really matter here is whether it causes suffering to sentient beings and what it contributes to the world. 

So, does it cause suffering? Well, if you listen to the folks who shout that it's murder and then carry on explaining everything in explicit detail, then I guess it does. But, you know, speaking as the guy who brings up '56 billion' on virtually every single topic I visit, I can honestly say that I never have to resort to going too much in detail how animals suffer when I try and make my points and there's no reason for me to accept that these people who utilize appeal to emotion are credible.

Sorry, but if both sides claim something that's factually conflicting, I'm going with the one that doesn't have fundamentalist loonies which have done a lot to destroy their credibility with me.

Now, does abortion contribute anything to the world? Well, this whole notion of 'women being able to do what they want with their body' is a nice little sentiment, but if it causes suffering I honestly don't think someones sense of entitlement permits them to do 'whatever they want' simply because they happen to be a human being. So, if this being were to feel pain, I think we'd need a more legitimate reason.

Oh wait, I got one. Well, I mean, I've got a more legitimate reason than why all of you folks eat your hamburgers and your omelets do anyway -   because abortion is a legitimate means to reduce our massive population of 7.7 billion people.

I am generally pro-choice, but I have shifted my position from being allowed to abort upon request to being allowed to abort under extenuating/appropriate/justifiable circumstances. 

All cases involving rape victims and overall health of the woman and the offspring shouldn't even be subject to debate. Pro-life and religious fanatics don't seem to care about these matters, they just want more children because they 'belong to god and we need more church members'.

In cases where health matters are not a concern, there needs to be at least some formal processes that evaluate the woman's reasons, and it should at least be consensual between both parents (that is, assuming the father didn't just walk off and wants nothing to do with the woman). I cannot rationalize it when both parents are on opposite ends of the spectrum, and a decision is made against the other parent's will (they both bear the responsibility in my opinion). 

As for cases where they're not ready for this (assuming no health concerns or conflicts among the parents decision exists), life is full of things that we didn't want or didn't want it now, but often times we have to step up and deal with it.

First off, every person who has some common sense knows that when you have sex a consequence may be pregnancy, and legalising abortion basically is making it ok for anyone to do what ever they want without being responsible for their actions and dealing with the consequences.
Obviously there are circumstances of rape and in that case have the baby and then give it up for adoption as many couples would love and appreciate the child more than you would.
The fetus is a life from the second it is conceived. A 50 year old women is just as much a life as a 2 second old fetus, so if murdering a 50 year old is illegal then so should murdering a fetus be.

This trait is extremely likely to come from the brain, as it is a human's vessel of thought. In early stages of development (before the brain has developed), abortion is not really murder, as there is likely no sentient person on the receiving end of the action.

An argument cannot be made to compromise a woman's freedom for something that isn't even able to think, even if it is technically a human. It is morally worse to kill an animal for meat than to abort an embryo in its early stages, as it probably perceives more than the embryo.

Note what Josephus, in his histories of the Jews, states concerning abortion, ""The law orders all the offspring to be brought up, and forbids woman either to cause abortion or to make away with the fetus, a woman convicted of this is regarded as an infanticide because she destroys a soul and diminishes the race."" 

The United States is a country where 5,500 abortion clinics abort 30% of all pregnancies. In our nation's capital there are three abortions performed for every one live birth, and this is not uncommon. Since 1980 abortions have outnumbered live births in 18 metropolitan areas of the United States. The shame of this problem is reflected in the statistic that 99% of all abortions are performed on demand. This means that the only prerequisite that is demanded of the mother is her desire to rid herself of the developing fetus. For years we have heard the cry that if abortions were abolished, ""What would happen to the woman who finds herself in the position of having been raped, involved in incest, has a severe fetal deformity, or her life is at stake?"" The way this argument is presented leads one to believe that abortions are here because of such cases. However, let us not blind you with the facts! Only 1% of the abortions performed annually in this country are for rape, incest, fetal deformity, or the mother's health. Many believe that the percentage is even smaller than this. Let us note a fact concerning pregnancy in the case of rape or incest. ""The case of rape and incest is really a non-issue because of its rare occurrence. It is estimated that in 5,000 to 10,000 rapes, only one pregnancy will result. In a typical US city with a population of 500,000 that would be one case every 10 to 20 years!""

 There are at least five major procedures that are used to terminate an unwanted pregnancy. (1) The vacuum suction method. ""The vacuum is so powerful that the baby is instantly broken up into a fluid mass of blood, tissue, and cartilage."" (2) The cutting up method. ""The doctor just slices the baby into pieces inside the womb of the mother. The skull is crushed with the forcepts to reduce its size for the withdrawal."" (3) The surgical method. ""The abdomen of the mother is surgically opened and the baby removed. The baby is then either used in experiments or else burned or drowned in water."" (4) The Saline Method. ""A salt solution is injected into her amniotic sac where the baby is literally burned to death -in effect pickling the baby.

ETC

But, Do all of those reason have the same importance? We need to simplify... What is the fundamental question? The fundamental question is whether the embryo is a person o not.

If the embryo is not a person, women will decide what they want... Anyone can choose for them, if abortion has risks is their life. Is like jump with a parachute from an airplane. It is their decision.

But if it is a person, that live should be protected.

There are two objective reasons to think that that is a person.

The continuity argument
We need a start up point that everybody agree: ""All of you are people""
A Question: a second before, Were you a person? Yes of course.
And yesterday, Were you a person? Yes of course.
Therefore, Since when you were a person? The exact time, please. 
When you were born? But you were the same that one second before. There was not a qualitative change. What happened at that moment from the embryo point of view? Only that he began to breathe through the lungs. But the embryo was the same one second before. Therefore it is not the point that we are looking for. 

And what about when it was inside the woman. It is a continuous process, so there is any point that it could became from a no-person to a person. Why? Because you can not be a 90% person, or you are a person o you aren't. Or you can be murder or not. There is no intermediate points. A continuous process can not be joint with a discrete process. It is not a solid argument. It is not philosophically coherent.

So, when did you became a person? At the conception. Why? Because you get a new DNA, different from your parents. At that moment, you have defined your sex, your skin colour, your facial features, and a lot of hereditary traits. Is it a enough qualitative change? Of course it is.

Murder is the “unlawful killing of a human being” with some level of intent. California law includes “a deliberate intention unlawfully to take away the life of a fellow creature.”

stopabortion6The only thing preventing abortion from being included in the definition of murder is that it’s currently not “unlawful.” But basic science proves that an unborn child is a “human being.” No mention of “personhood” is necessary for basic murder definitions. Killing a “human being” or a “fellow creature,” even, is enough.

Why, as a society, do we pick and choose human beings whom we can deliberately kill? These human beings are fully human, entirely innocent, and helpless and voiceless. Yet we purposely target them, setting very few restrictions on their killings.

Is there any other class of human beings that our society will make it “lawful” to kill? Belgium is already on the path to extending legal murder through its legalization of euthanasia – even child euthanasia. History shows that Nazi Germany, once it began to legalize the murder of human beings, simply continued down the path – the elderly, the sick, the disabled, gypsies, homosexuals, the Jews, those who defended the Jews. Where would it have stopped?

This is why abortion must be illegal if murder is illegal. It should never be “lawful” to kill any innocent human being.

1190,1582734815-1386,https://www.debate.org/opinions/is-abortion-wrong,"In the year I was born, almost one-third of all pregnancies ended in abortion.

In the past 40 years, abortion has claimed more than 55 million lives. In Pennsylvania alone, an unborn child dies every 15 minutes in an abortion.

It is precisely facts like these that convince me - and so many in my generation - that abortion is unnecessary and wrong.

The facts show all too plainly how any of my siblings, friends or classmates could have been killed before they had a chance to be born. And they make me wonder how many of my peers I will never know.

In January of 1973 when the U.S. Supreme Court issued its abortion ruling in Roe v. Wade, young women did not have access to the facts about abortion that we have today. Nor did they have the perspective of looking back over 40 years of data showing the consequences of abortion on demand.

My generation does.

In the past 40 years, studies have shown that abortion is common, unsafe, and frequently the result of outside pressure on women.

We now know that at the moment of conception, the human embryo is a complete, unique life.

We now know that more than half of women who had abortions felt pressured into the decision.

We now know that most women have abortions for social reasons such as relationship issues, finances, career or education, lack of readiness for the responsibility.

We now know that hundreds of women have died and thousands more have been injured by ""safe,"" legal abortions.

We now know, thanks to a pro-life leader of my generation, that abortion facilities cover up sexual abuse, give incorrect information, and perform abortions simply because of a baby's gender.

These facts point to the injustice of abortion - both for women and unborn babies. These are the facts that motivate me and so many other young people to advocate for the vulnerable.

Take, for example, my childhood friend Ashley, who spends an exhaustive number of hours in her community promoting the value of every human life. In her gentle, compassionate way, she reaches out to expecting and new mothers and counsels post-abortive women. The spare time she has is dedicated to loving and caring for her severely disabled brother - and making sure everyone knows how valuable his life is, too.

And there is Hope, a vibrant, intelligent young woman whose passion for social justice is leading her to law school and nursing school. She plans to dedicate her expertise in both fields to the defense of life in the womb.

As young women, we know - not just believe - that abortion is wrong. After living our whole lives in a society that devalues life, we know that something needs to change.

That just reminds you all the time of the trauma the victim went through, and it's not fair. 

Now I want to address the ''use protection'' argument. Contraception is never 100% effective. Even if you use a condom, an IUD, and take the morning after pill after you have sex there is still a chance of getting pregnant. It's very small, but still there. And a person should have he right to have sex for pleasure and/or emotional bonding without wanting children. 

And by using the logic that aborting an embryo or a fetus which has the potential to become a life is murder, millions of men and women globally are homicidal maniacs, including me and you. Because egg cells have the potential to become a human life, yet they are killed off every month. And men would have it worse. Their sperm cells die constantly, and each of those sperm cells has the potential to become a human life.
