516	"A woman has a choice. If she wants a kid then have a kid. I know everyone is talking about the rape situation but everyone should know that rape is common. If a young girl was possibly impregnated by her very own father or older sibling then she should get an abortion. A friend of mine asked me "" If a girl was pregnant by her boyfriend shouldn't the boyfriend get a choice"" I think no. A woman's body is her own. We aren't slaves for men it's the 21st century for god sake. Also people keep bringing religion into it. If that's your religion then go ahead and have your raper's baby. I believe in a woman's choice and that's all i gotta say"	(35.14584843885997)
124	Ok, so you're pregnant, and probably had great sex with this stranger from a bar you've been to 2 weeks ago. He won't be the dad, but you'll HAVE to be the mom. Remember a foetus will turn in to a child once you give labour, something you used to be. You were the one taking the decision of hooking up with a guy in a bar, so you must've known better. Stay abstinent if you aren't ready to be a mother, you might as well be too drunk to get equipped before sex, so to be safe, take the pill. Since there is a risk of either methods not working, and you DO get pregnant, then there is nothing else you can do but make your own decisions reasonably, there are points where this debate could come to a clear end. You're either a bit dumb if it was YOUR conscious mistake, unless it was meant to be. Otherwise, you were most definitely taught the consequences of fooling around. But if it was rape, or a critical situation where your life might have been in clear danger, people would understand. You wouldn't want to care for a rapist's son.	(34.65162890603137)

Kind of like chopping down a tree, which, funnily enough, is what the conservatives support. And enough with the ""it's MURDER"" argument. Murder is defined as ""ILLEGALLY"" killing. Abortion is LEGAL. Get your facts straight."	(21.323288233796273)
579	"The fact you think a woman's pregnancy is your decision baffles me. You say if someone gets pregnant no matter the circumstances you do not abort it. How about you shut your mouth until you have a kid, she becomes pregnant before she turns even 15, and it was not her choice to become pregnant. Are you going to say to your daughter she must have this baby? If you do, you are simply insane and there is no other way to put it, you are too far gone to even argue with. But if you would not force your extremely young daughter to abort her baby, you cannot bend the rules. If in this circumstance you reasonably understand it is not right to force the child to have a baby, drastically changing her life, you do not have the right to force ANYBODY else to have a baby.

327	More people abuse abortion because they just don't want to have the baby or they had sex without protection than in the case of rape, where the child or victim cannot sustain the baby's life within in womb. Abortion is being used to clean up the mess and the accident that was possibly your fault in the first place. Using abortion to take a life that you have brought into existence because of a choice you made is mentally, ethically, and morally wrong.	(16.75435873403054)

185	Before a certain period it is not at all. What makes a person inherently precious, I think, is (dormant or active) consciousness: thoughts, feelings, memories, hopes, and awareness. Since consciousness depends on the development of the nervous system, and since it takes many months for the nervous system to mature, we can conclude that consciousness emerges gradually. Consequently, the inherent preciousness emerges gradually too. For a fertilized egg, there is no consciousness and also no history of consciousness (unless you believe in reincarnation). Even though all the DNA is there, the fact that there's no higher brain activity strongly suggests that there's no consciousness.	(12.41369014791945)
297	Why should you kill a baby that you made.

65	You are Killing a baby! What if that baby was YOU. Its not the babies fault the dude couldn't pull out or wear a condom. I can see its ok if the mother is really not able to have the baby and could die if she goes through. It says in the bible to not murder. I hope when you stand in front of God someday he tells you it was okay to kill that person.	(60.48551779777455)
354	We MUST be mature enough to know when is the right time to have sex. If you did have sex, abortion is not the solution and we must face the consequences of our actions.

What if the woman was raped? Why should she give birth to a child that was conceived against her will. She would look at that child and think of all the unhappy and terrible feelings that she felt while she was being raped. No child should feel like they're are the cause of such unhappiness. What if the child was conceived accidentally. The same thing with the woman being raped. Why should a child be subjected to such sadness of being an accident.	(11.241243361916853)
247	Everybody says that abortion is wrong because it is murdering a living being. What people forget about abortion when it is performed is that the fetus is not yet alive. Most abortions are usually done within the first trimester, when the fetus has barely developed. A being cannot have self-sustaining until the brain has fully developed, and you can't kill something that isn't even alive. I feel that this debate is too important on the issue of women's rights to even consider that the religious argument should hold any weight in this debate, so I will not respond to any of the religious arguments. In the end, if you don't like abortion, don't have an abortion.	(6.2273898879240885)

Why should we have this sort of debate about a fetus? It is the same species as us, and therefore should be treated as so, regardless of intellect or ability to live outside of he woman. Woman have the choice to use contraception, and the choice to have sex or not. If you WILLING chose to have sex, you should know that sex and procreation are forever linked, and that taking the easy way out just to go back to having sex again is not taking responsibility.

286	Unless your child is Satan's spawn, this is the killing of a child who has done no wrong in this world and deserves a chance at the wonderful illusions that life has to give to us. This baby has not yet gotten to meet the beautiful parents that it would have had. This baby has not gotten to witness the fall colors, the snow falling in the winter, the hot sand in the summer or the drops of rain in the spring. It is deprived all these freedoms we are said to have. This is like a child getting murdered before it even turns a year, or one dying in a car wreck, it no longer gets to witness the wonders of life, because the choice the parents have made. If you are responsible enough to have this child conceived, you are responsible enough to give birth, even if this child is put up for adoption, you are still giving the child a chance to change the world, and make it a better place.

66	A fetus is still a breathing organism with a heartbeat and is still human.At least let it experience life.Not only does abortion go against the rule thou shall not kill,but it also destroys the amazing creation that GOD is working on.Abortion wasn't mentioned nor did it exist in the bible.The term fetus wasn't   mentioned either .So technically over 1billion of GOD's creations were killed by their own mothers.Instead of killing innocent unborn babies and feeling emotionally scarred about it later choose a method of birth control like a hysterectomy or vasectomy which is most effective or consider adoption for the child. With these methods maybe there would be less controversy and arguments over abortion. Also if you can't afford a vasectomy or hysterectomy use a good condom or use timing /calendar	(33.7506971807978)
371	Some people have clearly never heard of abstinence. If you weren't prepared to face the consequences of sex, why bother doing it in the first place? The only people who should legally be able to have an abortion are people that have been raped. If you had sex out of your own free will, protected or not, you should have been able to be ready to care for a baby. Funny how all the people who are for abortion were born, isn't it?

219	No i don't think abortion is wrong sense, sense there not even alive or thinking at that point. There not considered babies. A egg may be fertilized but it's not murder in my personal opinion abortion is not wrong. There's many good reason's why abortion is not wrong as people say it is.

580	Anyone can choose their own way of living even if it implies something like abortion, they can choose between options and, sometimes, its better to abort so they can avoid a poor way of living just because they have to deal with a non born person, that isn't even a person.	(31.43611244809119)
577	I don't have enough space or time to explain how strongly I feel about this, or to give the countless arguments in favour of abortion. All I will say is that the ONLY instance where abortion is unacceptable is when it is used as a form of contraception (so when people have unprotected sex with the idea that if the woman gets pregnant she can just have an abortion). This is just pure laziness and is totally unnecessary. Nowadays there are plenty of reliable forms of contraception out there (condoms, the pill, the implant etc.)- use them. Other than that, a woman's body is her own business and no-one has the right to say what she can or cannot do with it.	(30.968978459599743)
293	I believe that abortion is wrong. Every person who is being developed in a person's body should have a chance to live. There are shootings happening all around the world and the United States trying to stop it but abortion is still legal. It is so dumb that people can kill a human being when they made the choice of having sex. Honestly, I think that if you're going to become pregnant and then have an abortion then do not have sex or wrap it.	(28.752602278081415)
212	"The law against abortions after the third trimester is justified, at that point the baby is more human then not. However, abortion in the first six months is fine. A fetus is not a person, nor is it a human, it is an organism and an undeveloped entity that is not capable of voicing it's opinion on it's own death. All those ""let the babies choose"" adds are hogwash, they are stating that even single-celled organisms are people, and that is just nonsensical poppycock. It is not a punishment to the fetus to terminate a pregnancy, nor is it wrong, it is the parent's decision whether they want to have a child yet. If abortion were to be banned, what about all the rape victims or teenagers who get pregnant by accident, and then have to make their way through high school with a child in their arms? Criminalizing abortion should never be an option on the table, it is a perfectly justifiable medical procedure that some fictional man sitting in the clouds says is wrong."	(27.135287824713004)

352	Yes women should have a choice but they make that choice when they chose to have sex. As for cases of rape and incest , incest could have serious medical implications for a child, and not all women could care for a child after being raped. However a lot   women have abortions for selfish reasons and regret it after. Women who take pills to miscarry see their baby and only then realise what has happened. Abortion scars women and most importantly ends in the death of a child.	(70.4307793599994)

363	Abortions is the same as taking a human life whether the offspring is mentally retarded or perfectly normal. Abortions, not only are sins, but is also a way for society to commit adultery, teen sex, Pre-marital sex, etc. , and get around the natural qualities of life. The opposition may say that abortions can rid of unwanted babies, disabled babies, incidental babies(--_--), or infanticide( which is still infanticide because a non-related dominant male or female, the doctor, is eradicating a defenseless infant), but that doesn't make the case any different in the aspect of murder and nature. Now, there are cases where a female may be raped (forceful unwanted sex placed upon a man to women or vice versa) and they are impregnated. As painful as this may be or seem, nature has it's way of populating, even if a immature demon in a human body is forcing his sperm into a egg that is not his own. Now, I'm not saying people can't have a opinion, a choice, or a compelling force from within but if you want to have a helping hand in deciding if abortions are right or wrong, then here is my reason to why abortions are wrong ( to me they are disgraceful). I am a 16 year old boy in high school and as a human being I have now given my opinion in 237 words to why abortions are wrong.	(48.14520211220168)
369	"LISTEN! Ninety-three percent of the abortions in America are for convenience. The mother's health is an issue only three percent of the time, and the baby's health is an issue only three percent of the time. Rape or incest are issues only one percent of the time. Ninety-three percent of all abortions in America are performed just because someone doesn't want a child! Besides, there IS adoption, or (the old fashion way) if you can't bear to go through adoption stuff, you can leave the child at someone's door step! Still, you should give the child at least a chance to LIVE! My mother was a single mother, and God (and other people, if you don't want to bring up Religion) has provided the needs for her to care for four children! Now I am an adult, but I still look up to her and thank her (who was once FLAT BROKE!) for not getting that abortion and for caring for me. My sisters became pregnant (one against her will, and the other became pregnant TWICE) and neither of them chose abortion! I'm not trying to ""condemn"" people who have, but trying to help them. Besides, your baby is like apart of you, and it would be scary to have to go through taking that away from you. I say keep yourself from the pain of going through that, but instead give yourself the joy of a new life! I know that some people can't afford it, but there are RESOURCES out there! Not to mention if you ASK someone. Still, when it comes to mom and dad, don't do anything stupid. You shouldn't have done that mistake in the first place (although it happens), and yes, if you were rapped, they will understand! Well, unless you have a um... Mother or father who has a different perspective, then that is a problem that must be figured out, but you will get through it one way or another!

There are many families who would love to be blessed with your child and can not have one of their own for some reason.

360	"First of all, an unborn baby is should still be considered ""living"" as it can feel real and intense pain which could in fact be even more intense than pain of a born child, after just 8 weeks from conception. Unborn babies have also been proven to have real emotions and when are aborted endure a horribly scary and painful death. People should have to live with the consequences of their actions and if they don't then we are teaching Americans to be not responsible. Also, if that is really all to much for the parents, adoption is always a perfectly fine option. I believe abortions should be outlawed completely unless the baby is of significant danger to the mother. This excludes reasons for lack of money, responsibility, rape, etc. If you can't handle a child but made the mistake of getting pregnant, deal with the consequences of it or put it up for adoption. Yes it is your body but I believe that argument is invalid since we are dealing with another human being's life. Just imagine if Martin Luther King Jr.'s mother was like ""nah i don't really want a baby"", or George Washington's, or anyone historically important or even someone who just means a lot to you, like family. I can't even imagine all of the potentially great people we have let have been aborted...If you get pregnant, it is meant to be.

If a 17 year old girl makes a mistake and ends up pregnant, who is anyone else to tell her that she has to stop her life and stop school to focus on a child. The child can be neglected because the mother still is trying to live her young life, or starving because she just can not afford it.

320	In almost all cases, women do have a choice. They can choose to use protection, and if none is available, they can choose not to have sex.

Fuck God and fuck not being able to abort a child, abortion is NOT murder.	(12.47145953827109)
357	Yes, You have a choice to have an abortion. Although you have the choice it does not always mean that that is the best choice that you can possible chose. You should prepare for the risky situations before you even get there. Also if you think that getting rid of a child that is growing inside of your body is a good thing for you to do, I feel bad for you. If we just call the child a bunch of cells that are being formed into the shape of a living and breathing child, Then I don't know what this world is coming to! Just imagine if every one stopped having children, Because they did not want the child to get in their way of their pursuit of happiness. This whole world would cease to exist and everyone would die along with it. We must think about the consequences of our choices before we make these choices. We must think about what would happen before we make a choice that could alter the rest of our lives, Either for the better or for the worse we must sit down and think about the consequences. You have the choice either way you can choose life and responsibility, Or you can choose death and our so called pursuit of happiness. I hope that next time you choose you carefully weigh out the options. That's all I have to say. I hope you choose wisely and think about the lifelong consequences of both options.

That's the price you pay. Pregnancy Isn't a bad thing, having sex when you knew what the consequences were just to feed your lust is."	(9.583689146665895)

22	Abortion is murder. You are killing a human being, once it has heartbeat that child is alive. Yes, in certain circumstances such as rape or the fetus being a danger for the mother to live, then that is understanding for a mother to have an abortion, otherwise.. NO! WHY should an unborn child have to suffer because the mother wanted to be not responsible? Even if she did take all precautions to not getting pregnant she STILL knows that there is a possibility of getting pregnant regardless.     Now what I feel they should do is put limit to this. For instance ,   alcohol in some states is illegal if you drink before the age of 21 or the age of 18, but afterwards it becomes legal in cases like this, if a female gets raped or can't hold the child due to medical reasons then NO, she should have the choice to have an abortion. Adoption is always an option though and even if that child is in unloved homes, or foster cares for years, etc. Well , that's God decision to decide how the child's future would be, not yours. Abortion is all around wrong, and in the bible it states it clearly but of course there is exceptions for certain situations.	(11.75392134639999)
586	We all know deeply inside that it ultimately is a women's choice to choose what happens in her body. Who are we to tell her how she functions? What if the baby can't be kept financially and the mother doesn't want to put it up for adoption? What if the baby carried a disease in the mother's stomach that put her at risk? What if the mother was drinking, smoking or doing drugs and wouldn't want the baby to suffer? These scenarios are varieties of when abortion should occur. But I think after 8 weeks, the baby should be kept and not aborted. That's my limit because it will just begin to develop life. It is still an embryo when aborted so it does not have the organs a functioning baby has. Therefore, that is my opinion on abortion.	(11.049211989509427)

205	Abortion is in no terms wrong. Naturally, it is a difficult decision and can be very emotionally difficult for the mother. However, in circumstances, bringing a child into the world can be a worse decision; some people are not fit to be parents. Abortion is not murder. One is not killing an innocent child through the act of abortion. Instead, the foetus is being disposed of before it has the capability to feel through the development of the central nervous system. The deadline for legalised abortion is still before this development, so at no point is one harming the baby. Yes, the child could grow up to cure cancer. Or, the child could grow up to be a mass murderer. Human intelligence does not suffice for us to try and comprehend and predict future events. But on any account, abortion is not murder.

440	Many people think that because I was adopted I should be pro-life because I could have been aborted, but I remain pro-choice because I would never have known about my life if I was. If it would have made my biological mother happier, then ultimately it would be fine with me because it's her body that was holding me and her life that would have been altered if she kept me. Although adoption is a choice, there are thousands of children out there without any parents, still waiting to get adopted, and some are very unhappy because of it. I'm aware of the consequences that can come with abortion, but keeping the baby/having the baby adopted isn't for everyone, just like abortion isn't either.	(25.84011566352207)

Why are we even killing them? They never did anything to us in order to deserve death. Parents just think the babies guilty for being alive but your the one who made it(with the exception of your husband or boyfriend)	(38.57612378958409)
74	"An abortion overall is very unnecessary. I get it, Its a women body and she should choose what she wants to do with it, But have we ever stop to consider the other life in that body? It might be her body, But there is also another life inside of her and its not her life to end. For example the minute her doctor announces to her that she is pregnant she doesn't stop and think ""I have 20 fingers"" because why that life is separate from her. So I ask again when does life begin? To the people that think life begins when we are born would that mean you would still abort an eight month old baby in the womb or seven. When would be the time where we decide life starts. For those of you who did not a baby can't start to grow until whats called conception which is when the egg and the sperm meet. Its obvious to me that, Without that a baby can not start to form and that is where life for everyone begins. Have you ever stop to think if being pro-choice even makes sense to you, Or do you just keep using the rape excuse until someone budges? Think what is the opposite of life, Is it not death? Sounds harsh, I know but that's what your covering death with that choice, And what is the final choice to take away the life of the baby. I personally if you can't already tell am pro-life, And I try to hear people out and   see it from another point of view. I thought to myself if I was raped and got pregnant should I abort. My final answer would be no. Why? I would choose not to not just because statistically its a very very low possibility of that happening but because I believe that if god wanted me to be pregnant then so be it. I would love my child because the child wouldn't have been the problem. For those who wouldn't want it, Does it really cost you to let your baby live and put up for adoption instead of paying what thousands for an abortion. Also, To the ones who might have their health be at risk for having a baby, I believe in miracles and they happen everyday no women, No doctor, No man can tell you the final answer only god because whether we like it or not he has the final say, And finally for the ones who would still choose to abort because they made one stupid mistake and don't want to be embarrassed its not the babys fault and you know that very well."

I know adoption can be a better option sometimes, but for some circumstances it is not an option, and also pregnancy and childbirth can be very taxing and painful to the mother. I believe that abortion should be a legal option, but should only be used if it is the best solution.	(31.190530170406387)

528	Well, most of us can agree that nature is definitely not perfect however this includes pregnancy. Defects and other medical problems can lead to the death of both the child and the mother if an Abortion is not considered (Well, I can end it here, Abortion isn't wrong). However, there's always grey sides to this story, abortion isn't morally wrong even if the women isn't in a serious danger if you consider financial problems or other personal problems but right to the point. Abortion is not for anyone to choose or judge based on their moral teachings and principles, it is based on if the women chooses if she wants to remove the potential child from her own body.

I've never been pregnant, but if a man ever slips one past the goalie, there's no way I'm keeping it.  I'm not ruining my (already on the chubby side) body for a baby I don't want and can't support.  Snuffing out a fetus and murdering a conscious little baby is very different.  The fetus has no idea it's being killed; it feels the same way you, the reader, did in the year 1800 and will in 2350; absolutely nothing, because you weren't born in 1800, and will be long dead by 2350.

Because past decisions have and will always influence new and upcoming choices. Someone on this planet just decided to rape another. The victim of that rape had unknowingly become pregnant. At the earliest of stages, that woman has a choice: she could let the fetus grow to become a full-fledged human being who would later on in life have the power of choice, or she could remove the fetus while its still not capable of thinking for itself. There are just too many variables to judge what is human and what is not. But for the most part, we know who is human: the rape victim. Are you willing to deprive this adult of her choice just so that a plausible newborn could have theirs? I consider THAT wrong and downright immoral. Abortion, when used properly, will yield the right results that's good for a woman's well-being.

289	"I could give a list of reasons explaining how abortion ends a human life. However, That is an old (still unbeaten) argument. So I also approach it like this. Abortion affirms the disease in our culture that is fear of responsibility. People do not want the responsibility of a child because they could not wait until marriage, Graduation, And a solid job.
