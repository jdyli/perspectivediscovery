"Your denying the right to give this child a chance in the world. Your stripping away his opportunity to create something and become a benefit to society.

One would have been one of the greatest popes to ever live, the other would have found a cure to cancer. Seriously!

Read C.S Lewis's Matter of Abortion. It is about a demon writing a letter to another demon on how they think abortion is right. 
           In the article, Matter of Abortion, the author proclaims that humans have a right to deny the freedom to life. The reason the author gives us the right is because he feels we have rights over our own body. The author feels if a woman finds out she is pregnant unplanned, and she feels that the baby inside will ruin her chance in life, she automatically decides to deny the life of her own flesh and blood for her own benefit. God’s gift of life is precious. In our selfish world, humans believe they have the liberty to do whatever they please, to please themselves and to make their lives better. People are easily led to believe that they have authority over their own body, to take a life to make their life better, even if it means taking away a precious gift. In the article, Matter of Abortion, the author says:   “With creative cunning, we have corrupted, ‘loving our neighbor as self’ into ‘sparing my neighbor from any discomfort I would want to be spared from.’ Since I would want my daughter spared from the punishment- as one of statesmen have called it- of an unplanned pregnancy, I will not deny my neighbor’s daughter the same relief.”   The goal of abortion is to rid the ‘discomfort’. In the eyes of the devil, “abortion does the cause no good, unless it delivers souls to the nether banquet.” If all their (evil) work succeeds only in the death of the baby, for which the mother later feels remorse and seeks forgiveness, they have failed miserably. What they seek in abortion is not only the death of a baby, but the feeling of the inability for forgiveness. They want her to feel lost, alone and disgraceful. To fulfill the hopelessness of any possibility to be loved again or be forgiven. They want her to be isolated from everything and everyone, especially from God.   But what the devil doesn't understand is that God forgives. He is ultimately, true love. His grace is unconditional, and He forgives.
Acts 13:38 says: Therefore, my friends, I want you to know that through Jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you. Through Christ, our Savior, we can be saved. We can be forgiven through Him. Look at the Apostle Paul. He was murdering Christians for their faith. God confronted him, and Paul repented. He was washed from his sins, through the blood of Christ. Because Christ died for us, we now have a way to be saved.",0,1,"['none', 'shut', 'chose', 'genocide', 'heard', 'love', 'mentally', 'second', 'understand', 'father']",[18],1
"God made the baby in his image. The mother cannot decide whether she wants his creation or not. The poor innocent baby had nothing to do with why she is pregnant and should not be punished because of the situation. The difference between her and the baby is her size, and level of development, and that the baby has no say in what is to happen to him or her.",1,1,"['pay', 'stomach', 'pleasure', 'commit', 'foetus', 'good', 'foster', 'deserve', 'love', 'truly']",[18],2

"Bible-believers hold God’s Word as their absolute authority. There is absolute morality because there’s an absolute authority. And as a result, we believe that abortion kills a human being because each human being is designed in God’s image (Genesis 1:27) and carefully knit together in the mother’s womb by God (Psalm 139:13–16). The Bible makes no distinction between life that’s been born and life that hasn't been. Therefore, murdering an unborn life is just as heinous as murdering a life that has been born.",3,1,"['experience', 'machine', 'happiness', 'ok', 'compromise', 'remember', 'okay', 'able', 'support', 'individual']",[18],4
"Ok, so you're pregnant, and probably had great sex with this stranger from a bar you've been to 2 weeks ago. He won't be the dad, but you'll HAVE to be the mom. Remember a foetus will turn in to a child once you give labour, something you used to be. You were the one taking the decision of hooking up with a guy in a bar, so you must've known better. Stay abstinent if you aren't ready to be a mother, you might as well be too drunk to get equipped before sex, so to be safe, take the pill. Since there is a risk of either methods not working, and you DO get pregnant, then there is nothing else you can do but make your own decisions reasonably, there are points where this debate could come to a clear end. You're either a bit dumb if it was YOUR conscious mistake, unless it was meant to be. Otherwise, you were most definitely taught the consequences of fooling around. But if it was rape, or a critical situation where your life might have been in clear danger, people would understand. You wouldn't want to care for a rapist's son.",3,1,"['experience', 'machine', 'happiness', 'ok', 'compromise', 'remember', 'okay', 'able', 'support', 'individual']",[18],4
"I believe that abortion is wrong for many reasons but just the tip of the iceberg is that it is just immoral.  It is a proven fact that a fetus has a heartbeat after 5 weeks, around the same time some doctors like to perform them. In the Bible one of God's 10 commandments is ""thou shall not kill"".  Even if you do not believe in god you cannot deny the fact that it is killing children.",4,0,"['rapist', 'infant', 'clump', 'hell', 'step', 'gotten', 'fail', 'nervous', 'together', 'unnecessary']",[18],5
"For the Christians out there, if the life of the mother is in danger, abortion is still immoral.   God reserves the right to take someone home, whether that person is 20 weeks in the womb, or 20 years.   And a large percentage of those abortions because ""the life of the mother is in danger,"" are called that because the physician can earn more money for that diagnosis.   In fact, many times, a pregnancy cures the ailment rather than furthering it.",2,0,"['environment', 'look', 'hand', 'change', 'mature', 'whatever', 'sexually', 'hard', 'dangerous', 'unstable']",[18],3
"Everyone is born with the same rights as a human. How selfish of people to take a life that is not there own but the babies own life. Even if the baby is brought up by bad parents they still deserve a chance to choose and make there own choice, God would rather someone who sins then not someone at all. God loves all human life and it is a gift to be taken care of, even if the baby is not brought up by his/her own parents, better that then not at all.",3,1,"['experience', 'machine', 'happiness', 'ok', 'compromise', 'remember', 'okay', 'able', 'support', 'individual']",[18],4
"Why is abortion not considered murder, but if one kills a pregnant woman, they are charged with a double homicide?   Why is it unacceptable for a stranger to kill an unborn baby, but it's acceptable for mothers and doctors to do so? The baby that you are thinking about aborting could be the next Einstein or Beethoven or they could find a cure for cancer.   Children are gifts from God. Even if you cannot provide for the baby, they are plenty of couples that long for a baby, but aren't able to have one. You could put the baby up for adoption and answer someone's prayers",5,1,"['method', 'creature', 'member', 'condition', 'humanity', 'love', 'new', 'great', 'organ', 'good']",[18],6
"God created all life on earth. Women should think of themselves as god when abortion comes into play in their life. You see, god believes, as read in the bible, that we are all created in his image. Now, that child that rest in your belly women, that's god's creation. If that baby wasn't intended by you, it was intended by god. Keep in mind that their are many organizations willing to help a pregnant women, woman. So come on, don't commit murder on what's growing inside. See, a babies heart beats after 2 weeks. It's murder after you abort.

A baby is living in the womb and deserves a chance. If your raped give the baby away. Pro-abortionists say that outlawing abortion would restrict a woman’s right to privacy. Is that right absolute? Does somebody’s right to privacy exceed another’s right to live? God created life and it is a sin to take it away.,1,1,"['pay', 'stomach', 'pleasure', 'commit', 'foetus', 'good', 'foster', 'deserve', 'love', 'truly']",[18],2
"From a religious point of view, of course abortions are wrong! God commanded man and woman to be fruitful and multiply (in marriage) to populate the earth. Unless I was absent the day of Sunday school or in the 10 years I spent at a Christian school we were taught that God said we could kill an unborn baby for whatever reason, I don't think it's right. 

From a political point of view, abortions are just an easy way out of parenthood. Feminists believe it's their right to get an abortion if they want to since it's ""their body"". Well, what about the baby inside them? They could be a female. Where's her rights? You just took hers away by allowing doctors to vacuum her out of your womb! How DISGUSTING. Also, abortions cause long term effects on a woman's body and mind. Any mother to be always becomes emotionally attached to her child the minute she finds out she's pregnant. Killing her child should be the LAST thing on her mind! Not to mention if she wants to have kids later on in life, she probably won't be able to conceive again bc of her previous abortions. They can affect fertility.

In the bible in exodus 20: 13 it says you shall not murder. I think it's wrong because it is killing a human being even if it is a fetus . It's still alive because it has a heart beat.

You are Killing a baby! What if that baby was YOU. Its not the babies fault the dude couldn't pull out or wear a condom.

"Bottom line- killing another child is homicide...Murder. If you decided to have sex and you, as a female, end up pregnant, that's your responsibility. If you were raped, then you're not at fault. However, if you do not want a child, then the better alternative is to put the child in the care of dependable, responsible adults you know closely and can trust.

"Supporting abortion is akin to supporting murder. God is life, the source that provides the mechanisms for life to take place. Life is awareness and death is the absence of awareness. To choose life supports God's will. To choose and support abortion is to choose Satan's will: death.   How is this subject debatable? God is in the creation of each life from conception to birth. Aborting the development of God's creation is, I believe, the worst possible sin. I wrote to President Obama challenging him to discuss this matter. He has been misled to believe a woman has the right to choose to murder God's creation. Ask a child what they say about abortion. Children are innocent and would never say they think terminating a child's chance at life is right in God's eyes. Before we are born we go through a process. That process begins with sexual conception and leads to the process of life. God is in the cells that create life, so when we abort that process we murder God's creation. We as humans have no right ever to stop the process that is created by our creator. I can go on and on, but if it you can't see that abortion is wrong then you are not in touch with creation.

"There is a distinct separation of those who are for the value of life and those for the destruction of life. It has always been a division of religion.

Adoption is always an option though and even if that child is in unloved homes, or foster cares for years, etc. Well , that's God decision to decide how the child's future would be, not yours.

"An abortion overall is very unneccessary. I get it, Its a women body and she should choose what she wants to do with it, But have we ever stop to consider the other life in that body? It might be her body, But there is also another life inside of her and its not her life to end. For example the minute her doctor announces to her that she is pregnant she doesn't stop and think ""I have 20 fingers"" because why that life is separate from her. So I ask again when does life begin? To the people that think life begins when we are born would that mean you would still abort an eight month old baby in the womb or seven. When would be the time where we decide life starts. For those of you who did not a baby can't start to grow until whats called conception which is when the egg and the sperm meet. Its obvious to me that, Without that a baby can not start to form and that is where life for everyone begins. Have you ever stop to think if being pro-choice even makes sense to you, Or do you just keep using the rape excuse until someone budges? Think what is the opposite of life, Is it not death? Sounds harsh, I know but that's what your covering death with that choice, And what is the final choice to take away the life of the baby. I personally if you can't already tell am pro-life, And I try to hear people out and   see it from another point of view. I thought to myself if I was raped and got pregnant should I abort. My final answer would be no. Why? I would choose not to not just because statistically its a very very low possibility of that happening but because I believe that if god wanted me to be pregnant then so be it. I would love my child because the child wouldn't have been the problem. For those who wouldn't want it, Does it really cost you to let your baby live and put up for adoption instead of paying what thousands for an abortion. Also, To the ones who might have their health be at risk for having a baby, I believe in miracles and they happen everyday no women, No doctor, No man can tell you the final answer only god because whether we like it or not he has the final say, And finally for the ones who would still choose to abort because they made one stupid mistake and don't want to be embarrassed its not the babys fault and you know that very well.",3,1,"['experience', 'machine', 'happiness', 'ok', 'compromise', 'remember', 'okay', 'able', 'support', 'individual']",[18],4

"The primary reason abortion is wrong is because God said we are not to murder.   But not all people believe what God says, so let's look at it from a different angle. We are allowed to take life under the prescribed requirements of law, such as self defense, war, execution, etc.   Each of these areas deals with Law.   Self defense is justified because an antagonist is breaking the law (burglary, robbery, assault, etc.), and we can use force to protect ourselves and our property.   War is the legal declaration of hostilities towards another nation.   Execution is the legal taking of life against someone who has committed a crime, or crimes, worthy of execution.   In each case, the antagonists are dealt with for the wrongs they have committed. However, the baby in the womb has done no wrong, yet it is executed.   It is executed but has broken no law!   What crime has been committed?   What law have they broken in their existence?   None.   Yet they are killed. I am reminded of Nazi Germany.   The Jews were guilty of being Jews, and were, according to the Nazis, worthy of death.   Likewise, the babies in the womb are guilty of being babies in the womb, and are, according to the parents, worthy of death.   What laws did they break?   What made them unworthy of life? The answer is simple: it depends on the opinion of those in power, of those wielding the knife and redefining what is life, and of those deciding who is worthy of life and who should die. It is only in abortion that someone is executed but has not violated the law.   This is fundamentally wrong, and this is why abortion is wrong. Since when do we kill someone who's broken no law? Since when do we kill someone who's only ""crime"" was being brought into existence via the copulation of his or her parents?",1,1,"['pay', 'stomach', 'pleasure', 'commit', 'foetus', 'good', 'foster', 'deserve', 'love', 'truly']",[18],2

Read C.S Lewis's Matter of Abortion. It is about a demon writing a letter to another demon on how they think abortion is right. 
           In the article, Matter of Abortion, the author proclaims that humans have a right to deny the freedom to life. The reason the author gives us the right is because he feels we have rights over our own body. The author feels if a woman finds out she is pregnant unplanned, and she feels that the baby inside will ruin her chance in life, she automatically decides to deny the life of her own flesh and blood for her own benefit. God’s gift of life is precious. In our selfish world, humans believe they have the liberty to do whatever they please, to please themselves and to make their lives better. People are easily led to believe that they have authority over their own body, to take a life to make their life better, even if it means taking away a precious gift. In the article, Matter of Abortion, the author says:   “With creative cunning, we have corrupted, ‘loving our neighbor as self’ into ‘sparing my neighbor from any discomfort I would want to be spared from.’ Since I would want my daughter spared from the punishment- as one of statesmen have called it- of an unplanned pregnancy, I will not deny my neighbor’s daughter the same relief.”   The goal of abortion is to rid the ‘discomfort’. In the eyes of the devil, “abortion does the cause no good, unless it delivers souls to the nether banquet.” If all their (evil) work succeeds only in the death of the baby, for which the mother later feels remorse and seeks forgiveness, they have failed miserably. What they seek in abortion is not only the death of a baby, but the feeling of the inability for forgiveness. They want her to feel lost, alone and disgraceful. To fulfill the hopelessness of any possibility to be loved again or be forgiven. They want her to be isolated from everything and everyone, especially from God.   But what the devil doesn't understand is that God forgives. He is ultimately, true love. His grace is unconditional, and He forgives.
Acts 13:38 says: Therefore, my friends, I want you to know that through Jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you. Through Christ, our Savior, we can be saved. We can be forgiven through Him. Look at the Apostle Paul. He was murdering Christians for their faith. God confronted him, and Paul repented. He was washed from his sins, through the blood of Christ. Because Christ died for us, we now have a way to be saved.",2,0,"['environment', 'look', 'hand', 'change', 'mature', 'whatever', 'sexually', 'hard', 'dangerous', 'unstable']",[18],3

"This is my personal opinion on abortion. A fetus is alive; yes but it is no more alive than the emotionless and numb skulled cows and pigs you eat. Everything is alive so by scientific definition of life, that's not enough. We eat plants and they're scientifically alive. We eat meat and they're scientifically alive. It doesn't matter if it has the 7 signs of life because we need a philosophical definition of what it means to be alive. ""Life starts at conception."" Life can have the scientific and philosophic definition but only one (scientific) starts at conception while the other (philosophical) is more so after the first trimester when they become more human being then unrecognizable sack of brainless meat. I think for the first trimester it is okay. I think under the second trimester you better have a pretty convincing reason but under the third, you're screwed and i don't think its right. Adoption is not a suitable or better alternative option so if the mother/parents are forced to have the child and they a.) cannot afford the child financially b.) cannot give them the proper love and attention c.) just don't want it a lot of the time they just end up dyfus and back in the system. Besides there's a creature inside a person that's making them sick, making them ill, and taking their nutrients, it is self defense if a woman cannot handle it.

"The common argument from the pro-lifer crowd is the equating of abortion to the murder of another human being. However, that is simply not the case.

First, murder is the intentional killing of a person. From the Oxford English dictionary, murder is ""the unlawful premeditated killing of one human being by another."" The distinction of human being is important, because it is what distinguishes murder from killing. A person may swat a fly without a second thought, but the killing of another person is abhorrent. Similarly, a person may hunt animals and wild game, yet they would not shoot a person.

What makes murder wrong is that is is the killing of a being that is aware, sentient, and intelligent. Killing a being that is aware of its own existence and mortality is a cruelty that goes unmatched. It is the being's sentience that defines the cruelty, however. A fly or other simple animal has no sentience to speak of, and therefore is not hurt or traumatized through nonexistence.

The fetus in the first trimester is not aware nor does it even have the capabilities of awareness or feeling. How then can abortion be cruel if a fetus cannot possibly be aware of it? By definition, if a fetus is unaware of abortion, then it cannot be cruel. Though the fetus may be alive and human, it is not a person anymore than the cells in my arm are a person. A person requires sentience, something the fetus simply does not have.",2,0,"['environment', 'look', 'hand', 'change', 'mature', 'whatever', 'sexually', 'hard', 'dangerous', 'unstable']",[3],3

If that's what it makes it wrong enough to be illegal then what do you say about sexual abstinence and contraception? If you did not abstain or had protected sex, you could have given birth to a child. Each time when you use contraception, you deny life to that unborn child who would've taken birth if you hadn't! In this case also a potential human lost its chance to live! Is this tantamount to murder? By extension of the same logic one can say that each second we are not reproducing, we are committing murder. The fallacy of the argument is clear.
In my opinion, abortion should be avoided at all costs but it should be legal. An unwanted baby becomes the source of misery for both the parents and itself. Parents should have kids when they are ready to have them.

"What is it about a human life that makes it inherently valuable? A very common answer is a person's high sentience, or the ability to perceive. The inherent morality of aborting a fetus or embryo therefore comes from it's ability to perceive. This trait is extremely likely to come from the brain, as it is a human's vessel of thought. In early stages of development (before the brain has developed), abortion is not really murder, as there is likely no sentient person on the receiving end of the action.

An argument cannot be made to compromise a woman's freedom for something that isn't even able to think, even if it is technically a human. It is morally worse to kill an animal for meat than to abort an embryo in its early stages, as it probably perceives more than the embryo.

Overall, as long as it happens relatively early in the life of an embryo, there is usually nothing wrong (morally) with abortion.

Therefore, if it doesn't have a brain, is it truly alive? If it doesn't have a beating heart,   is it truly alive? In my opinion, no, they are not alive, they are just a fertilized cell that hasn't really started growing. #2 Most likely, everyone thinks murder is wrong because the people that die have something to live for or have good memories that should be preserved.

Beyond religious opinions and fictional statements such as ""life begins at conception,"" I am curious as to if there even is a valid, scientific argument that supports the notion of pro-life. I haven't seem to have found one yet.

Claiming a zygote (term for the fusion of a sperm and egg- for all of you ""pro-life scientists"" out there) is a human is an idea I find almost silly. Claiming that two cells is life is completely insane. A zygote has no organs, no sensation, etc. 

The boundary for when life begins is hazy, and in that case, I see an argument to when abortion should no longer be legally allowed. However, there is a definite period of time in which organs have yet to develop, sensation and neural processing has yet to occur, etc, in which abortion is medically supported to be legal.

"Dear MinnesotaWildChild,

My argument is mainly aimed at you as I am absolutely horrified by your statement, not to mention your reference to a 2 year old child being the same as a foetus. A foetus and a 2 year old have completely different abilities and a completely different brain capacity(being that a foetus has none). Can a foetus hold your hand? Can a foetus say I love you? NO. Therefore the fact that you even attempted to compare the two is ridiculous. Now, I am completely aware that there is a point whilst a foetus is developing that they transition from a foetus to a baby, however providing the abortion is before this time there is no reason to suggest the foetus to be considered a baby. 

""That baby was human at the time of birth, which means that it must have been human 5 minutes before the birth. So if the baby is a human before birth, then that means that it is a human while it is a fetus."" < this is a quote from you appalling statement and I think it might have been this part that shocked me the most. Granted a baby is a human 5 minutes before birth, however what about 7 months before this birth was it still a human then? When it did not even have fingers or toes? The answer is NO, it was not , it was just a bunch of cells, no thoughts, no feelings, just cells. A 2 year old on the other hand is a life. It has emotions, a heart, a pulse, a brain, it feels things that a foetus under the age of LEGAL abortion could never feel. Want to know why? BECAUSE IT IS WITHOUT A BRAIN AT THIS STAGE! 

And by the way you snuck in a snide comment about adoption always being another option, but I would like for you to imagine you carrying something for 9 month. You going through all the ups and downs a pregnancy can have, then after going through God knows how many hours of excruciating labour, you holding this tiny, defenceless, innocent baby in your arms and starring into its youthful eyes and feeling that bond and connection that you pray will never be broken. But wait there's an interruption at the door, oh that's right it's the parents you signed your baby off to 7 months ago when it was a still a foetus! What a shame!

"Although a fetus is a living breathing human, is it really alive?   Technically yes, but being alive has a different meaning from having a life.   I agree, it is horrible that a life is taken through abortion and that baby will never have its opportunity to live.   The one problem with society is that we make too many laws based on emotion.   A lot of pro-life people are against abortion, fine.   My question is why aren't many of them against birth control of any other types of contraception? Isn't that abortion as well? Isn't that taking the opportunity of life from a potential person?   The fact is, abortion and contraception has no difference but people only argue abortion because they see a developing human and start to get emotional when in reality, interrupting fertilization is also ""killing"" a human. 
Back to my point on being alive and having a life.   For example, if I was killed tomorrow, people would care.   My family who I am apart of, my friends who I've made laugh and feel good, etc.   Everyone's death has an impact on many peoples lives.   Lets admit it, people like us, and some people like our company.   If I were to be killed tomorrow many people would be devastated, and its a horrible thing.

A fetus has no personality, it hasn't made friends, it hasn't impacted people lives, and it hasn't done anything to make it desirable (except being someones potential child).

"Now, is a fetus a human being? This seems to be the central question. Well, if a fetus is a human being, how come the census doesn't count them? If a fetus is a human being, how come when there’s a miscarriage they don’t have a funeral? If a fetus is a human being, how come people say “we have two children and one on the way” instead of saying “we have three children?” People say life begins at conception, I say life began about a billion years ago and it’s a continuous process.

The really hardcore people will tell you life begins at fertilization. Fertilization, when the sperm fertilizes the egg. But even after the egg is fertilized, it’s still six or seven days before it reaches the uterus and pregnancy begins, and not every egg makes it that far. Eighty percent of a woman’s fertilized eggs are rinsed and flushed out of her body once a month during those delightful few days she has. They wind up on sanitary napkins, and yet they are fertilized eggs. So basically what these anti-abortion people are telling us is that any woman who’s had more than more than one period is a serial killer! Consistency. Consistency.

And the ""sanctity of life""? I mean, even if there were such a thing, I don’t think it’s something you can blame on God. No, you know where the sanctity of life came from? We made it up. You know why? ‘Cuz we’re alive. Self-interest. Living people have a strong interest in promoting the idea that somehow life is sacred. You don’t see Abbott and Costello running around, talking about this, do you? We’re not hearing a whole lot from Mussolini on the subject. What’s the latest from JFK? Not a thing. ‘Cuz JFK, Mussolini and Abbott and Costello are dead. They’re DEAD. And dead people give less than a $h!T about the sanctity of life. Only living people care about it so the whole thing grows out of a completely biased point of view. It’s a self serving, man-made bull$h!T story.

Even with all this stuff we preach about the sanctity of life, we don’t practice it. We don’t practice it. Look at what we’d kill: Mosquitoes and flies. ‘Cuz they’re pests. Lions and tigers. ‘Cuz it’s fun! Chickens and pigs. ‘Cuz we’re hungry.

And you might have noticed something else. The sanctity of life doesn’t seem to apply to cancer cells, does it? You rarely see a bumper sticker that says “Save the tumors.”. Or “I brake for advanced melanoma.”. No, viruses, mold, mildew, maggots, fungus, weeds, E. Coli bacteria, the crabs. Nothing sacred about those things. So at best the sanctity of life is kind of a selective thing. We get to choose which forms of life we feel are sacred, and we get to kill the rest. Pretty neat deal, huh? You know how we got it?

Abstinence is the fact or practice of restraining oneself from indulging in something.

Choosing to not use safe sex/birth control. In this world, we have a thing called free will. Free will is something people use to their advantage. Either it be good, or bad you deal with the outcome of it. If you choose to use safe sex, pregnancy is much, much, lower chance of pregnancy.   99% effective. 4.

Rape, obviously, and medical necessity...
That Embryo still does not deserve death, but the only person who made any decision was the rapist...

Or they just engage in promiscuous sexual debauchery believing that there will be no consequence for their not responsible actions. 

So what does that breed. A delinquent generation. Abortion affirms freedom of responsibility that manifests itself in fatherless and motherless homes. It also shows up in the form of welfare leeches. It manifests itself in the form of whiny and weeping children that just happen to be 30 years old. 

So what about ""My body"" or ""you're a male you don't understand"". Well first of all, That demeans the child even further by saying my body my choice.

"I am going to stay away from religion, because I believe their are great arguments that even a secularist could use in support of life. 
Pro-choice advocates always bring up the anecdotal, sad situation of a woman who was raped, will die if she has the baby, was just diagnosed with cancer, and has no money to afford the child.   The fact is that the vast, vast majority of abortions (somewhere around 99%) are due from sheer irresponsibility.   Such as skipping out on birth-control, being to lazy or inconvenienced to use a condom, drunk sex, having a change of heart, etc.   Yes, condoms break, yes birth control isn't 100% effective, but the failure rates are certainly not on par with the number of abortions performed.   Pro-choice should be willing to quit arguing on behalf of the anecdotal cases of rape, incest, and harm to the mother's life and instead discuss the 99% of abortions which stem from the belief that your right to convenience is more significant than a fetus's right to live.   Men who irresponsibly impregnate a female should also own-up to their mistakes, and support the child and his/her mother.   Conception is very simple, anytime one ejaculates inside of a females vagina, the potential for conception occurs.   If you feel that engaging in protected or unprotected sex is worth the potential risk of impregnation, then go ahead and have intercourse, but don't be surprised when life is conceived (and especially don't be surprised if you did not use protection and life is conceived).   If your not comfortable with the risk presented from sex, then abstain from vaginal intercourse.   Sorry, biology can be a pain the a$$.   Overall 99% of abortions can be prevented.   This myth that abortion is human right is simply a way to euphemize what you are actually doing, which 99% of the time is valuing your own convenience over another's life, which I find repulsive and despicable.",2,0,"['environment', 'look', 'hand', 'change', 'mature', 'whatever', 'sexually', 'hard', 'dangerous', 'unstable']",[24],3

If you do not want to have children then do not get pregnant, no excuses. Everyone should know how a baby is made. They do not just fall from the sky. You need to have sex and when you have sex you create a new life. This is what procreation is. Some people say that they do not feel they will be good parents. Well, did you think of this when you were getting down and busy? NO! Having a baby is always a thought that should be running through your head when you are in the heat of the moment. These things do not just happen just because, they happen out of actions. You have to understand that being able to lay down with a man will cost you in some way. I do not want to judge because I am not a saint. However, my thoughts are that you should not be having sex if you do not want to have children. Conception or not. Be mature about sex. It is nothing to play with when it comes to creating a new life. Then there are situations like teen pregnancy, but no one wants to listen when it comes to protection. They just are not mature or responsible when it comes to having sex. They do not tell their children what they should be doing in order to abstain from having a child that they are not mentally, emotionally, physically, financially or spiritually ready to take care of.",1,1,"['pay', 'stomach', 'pleasure', 'commit', 'foetus', 'good', 'foster', 'deserve', 'love', 'truly']",[24],2
"It has been clearly demonstrated that life begins at conception.  The idea that we have to wait until the fetus can feel pain or has a heartbeat is beside the point.

Furthermore, given the advances in medicine, there is virtually no reason for someone to become pregnant except by choice in this country.  By failing to take steps to prevent a pregnancy, and then choosing to have an abortion, we are punishing the unborn child for a mistake made not by them, but by one or both parents.  How would we all react if we knew of a case, only one, in which an innocent person were sentenced to die for the actions of someone over whom they had no control, simply because that person was not responsible?

But other than those special occasions I think the women has to have the baby and no matter what. One of the main issues that women argue about abortion being illegal is what if they were raped. That's why, in those types of cases I think its only fair to let the women decide. Because if they were raped and they did not have the choice to abort it then it could ruin there lives. But if they have the baby willingly, and were not raped but made a mistake, I think that that women has to step up and take responsibility for it. Women should not be able to have sex willingly but not want a baby, and then find out they are pregnant and just abort it, because then they will just do it again.

"Abortion should definitely not be legal for so many reasons.
First off, every person who has some common sense knows that when you have sex a consequence may be pregnancy, and legalising abortion basically is making it ok for anyone to do what ever they want without being responsible for their actions and dealing with the consequences.
Obviously there are circumstances of rape and in that case have the baby and then give it up for adoption as many couples would love and appreciate the child more than you would.
The fetus is a life from the second it is conceived. A 50 year old women is just as much a life as a 2 second old fetus, so if murdering a 50 year old is illegal then so should murdering a fetus be.
I completely agree with women having the right to do what ever they want to do with their body but in this situation it is affecting a life that could turn out to be amazing.

"It has been proven that the baby's heart begins to beat within (two weeks-was it?). So, technically: it is indeed murder. However, when you think about the case of a sexually abused woman, for example, what is the point of giving birth to that child? And I don't mean because the woman will have to dealt with an unwanted baby, but would you imagine being the product of a sex offender? Sure, it's not the kids fault, but if I discovered that one of my parents actually had the guts to ruin someone's life in a disgusting and destructive way... I just couldn't live with the horrible truth. 
   And aside from the psychological point, most of the people that disagree to abortion state ""she can just adopt if she doesn't want the baby"". Very true, and it seems like the ideal option. But I personally have seen the lives of orphans/foster children. It's not worth living a childhood waking up everyday praying for a family to proclaim you. And sadly, many of these kids grow up to being adults and never find a home. Because every parent wants the healthiest, youngest most adorable kid and would NEVER consider the offspring of a sexual offender. As if the kid himself were a rapist at age 3...

     And I know, I've said a lot about rape. Well, let's look at it from the angle of a mother that had an ""oops!"" or simply was too uneducated and not responsible to use contraception when she engaged in sexual activity. If it was an ""accident"" she obviously isn't ready to be a mother. (Let alone the father, if he's even around). And it all falls into the same option: adoption. 
     I personally wouldn't abort. I would love my child no matter his/her father. However, I know a lot of women who would rather jump off a cliff before having a child. If they won't have the baby, then the would be better of resting in peace then walking amongst the other 7 billion people on this miserable, selfish planet. Newsflash! The world is full of @$!#! Why bring an unwanted kid into the torture if no one's gonna take care of him or her?

     In conclusion, abortion is a very difficult decision. You are, in fact, killing a baby. However, with the corruption in this world, perhaps it's better to not even bring him/her to life. The decision is so debatable, I personally wouldn't do it, especially with the psychological trauma I could receive afterwards. But I support anyone who decides to do it.

If she gets pregnant, this trauma is further exacerbated, especially for those who are younger.

She will relive the rape every time she looks at   her kid, and cannot love him or her as a mother should. Think about the consequences for both the mother and the kid- feelings of abandonment and agitation. To those who claim there is a reason why women get raped, I agree- they get raped because the rapist can get away with it- so what if a child is born? They don't have to take care of it as the mother has to. The victim is bearing the dire consequences of someone else's actions, when there can and should be a choice if she wants to keep the child.

"Mothers, whether they are in their teens and from a background with poverty or are in their thirties with a strong socioeconomic standing, don't decide to have an abortion simply for the sake of it. That is to say- they typically have a reason for asking for such a procedure to be exercised. Children born into an environment where they're unwanted- whether it be because they cannot be provided for or they are a detriment to their mother or father's future plans- will often not receive proper parenting, and in the case of a large number of people seeking abortions- be born into an adverse environment. Sub-par parenting and harsh conditions lead children to become more likely to become criminals (https://www.Ncjrs.Gov/html/ojjdp/jjjournal_2003_2/page3.Html for those of you who think I'm pulling this out of my rear end).
Furthermore, forced living leaves the child burdened with the ubquitous sufferings of humanity without the comfort and joy of a mother or father that loves him. This leads to the question of whether all life is sacred, and if having a life at all is ""better"" than not. Now there is no statement of absolute morality which claims that life is sacred save religious scriptures. However, even disregarding the Free Exercise Clause and the separation of church and state, religious scriptures cannot be used as a rational basis for any argument contending that life is sacred, simply for the fact that religion is based on faith. Faith is, by definition, a belief that arises without logical reasoning. Therefore, any person who makes a claim that whatever religion they practice holds all life to be sacred, and as a result of that perceived ""sacredness"" finds abortion to be an abomination is committing the logical fallacy of ""begging the question""- making the unproven assumption that something is true.
Finally, I'd like to redirect this entire contention back to the main idea. ""Is abortion wrong?"" The term ""wrong"" itself implies the implementation of moral philosophy, but there are different ""types"" of morality. However, the form of morality most consistent with reality is consequentialism- where the ends justify the means. The argument from the Pro side (""Pro"" as it applies to debate) is that abortion ends a life. That certainly is bad, but from a moral perspective, that's not always ""wrong"". What would be wrong would be to insist that a woman give birth to a child that she doesn't want in the first place, condemning that child to a future without the exhilaration and comfort of being loved from the very beginning.

(I forgot to mention this as I was typing but a lot of people said adoption was a viable option. Unfortunately, mothers of babies that know that they will be giving their children up for adoption are much more likely to abuse substances during pregnancy.

"Let me get this one point across:
A lot of people say so simply ""just give birth to the baby and give it up for adoption."" Sure, put them in an orphanage, living with no parents, with no guarantee of adoption, with no guarantee of living a happy life, with no guarantee of getting a good education.

Some may picture them as careless, reckless, whores who bed with many people. I'm not saying all do but it is easy to think of them that way. Why do you think some teenage moms are shamed by people and they are degraded by them. But hey, all humans make mistakes. Some people are genuinely worried and scared for their lives when they find out they are pregnant. They feel immense pressure and regret from their mistake. Secondly, about those who say that the people   shouldn't kill their babies because of their mistakes, you are saying that you should let it live without thinking about what that baby might have to face in the future. Yeah, instead of aborting the still-growing fetus, freeing it from all the suffering it might have to deal with when it grows up, give birth to some accidental baby and dump it in an orphanage cuz hey, it deserves to live.

Let's take a look at it this way. Let's say you have a daughter, fourteen, young and beautiful. She has a boyfriend, but they don't do anything because she wants to be safe and she knows she's NOT READY to have a child at that age. Your young daughter is suddenly and unexpectedly raped--by the boyfriend who did not want to wait, someone on the street who saw her and felt he was entitled to doing whatever he wanted to her, or somebody she thought she could trust and evidently could not. However it happened, it happened, and now she has to deal with the consequences. Are you going to tell your fourteen year old daughter that her rape was God's will? Are you going to tell her that it's okay that sex was forced onto her, that she was hurt and violated but the child's life is more important than hers so she's a damn shame and disappointment if she wants to abort it? Are you going to force your CHILD to carry another child inside of her? Any teenager who is pregnant is more than likely exposed to several kinds of bullying and mistreatment for it, because she's seen as a disgusting slut no matter the situation. How is it fair to make a child go through that when the situation is not her fault? How is it fair to put more value in the fetus' life than the life of the female who is already living? Taking the option of abortion away from rape victims, especially teenagers, not only presents them to harsh treatment and scorn from their peers but also takes them away from school and the life they were supposed to be living before the pregnancy. Forcing pregnant females to carry through an unwanted pregnancy takes away from their ability to live their own life, which already exists. Teens drop out of school, are kicked out of homes. Adults can be shamed and scorned in their workplaces for ""getting themselves pregnant."" 
Excuse me? Can a woman get herself pregnant? No, it's not her fault. Why are you placing all the blame on the women?

No. Is it a woman's fault when her husband or boyfriend did not want to listen to ""I'm not ready"" or ""I don't want a child"" and chose to do what he wanted?

"Okay. I am just going to throw something out there. If you have a two year old, and you sit him/her in the middle of the room, and then you walk out of the room, the toddler does not die. If you take a newborn and do the same, it too survives. If you take an embryo, a zygote, or a young fetus and do the exact same thing, the child dies. Quite often, if you ask someone to tell you why abortion is wrong, they will bring God and religion into the conversation. Not many people have a reason without dragging their deity into the argument. So.....I can understand that abortion is wrong because we are told to value human life above all other life. Why is breaking an eagle egg a felony but abortion not?   Well....Yes.. God said that men have domain over all the other creatures on Earth. I feel that with that responsibility comes a moral obligation to protect those species (especially the endangered ones) (especially especially since men are often the reason other species struggle...E.G. The black rhino). So..What if God wants someone to get an abortion (don't yell ""Blasphemy"" yet), and to help someone grow or alter that person's life, he grants someone with a child that He never means to really live. Maybe He leads people to make the decision of abortion not to be ostracized by an unloving society that claims to be ""Christian,"" but to provide one with an opportunity for some personal growth. Now. All religion aside, why is abortion wrong? I don't know. I personally do not know that I would ever be able to abort a child I am pregnant with; however, I know the decisions I make for myself cannot be forced onto others who do not agree, and I would not want them to be. I am pro choice. I am pro-life. I am not pro-birth. I believe in loving children and providing them with every opportunity they deserve in spite of having to pay for it with my tax dollars.

I want to provide an opinion that is able to be read without making others shake their heads, scoff, or turn red with anger; I hope I was able to do so. . . .Don't ""murder"" the children, but more importantly, don't be too quick to judge one who makes an informed decision about his/her/an unborn child's health, regardless of what that decision may be.",0,1,"['none', 'shut', 'chose', 'genocide', 'heard', 'love', 'mentally', 'second', 'understand', 'father']",[2],1

This is just pure laziness and is totally unnecessary. Nowadays there are plenty of reliable forms of contraception out there (condoms, the pill, the implant etc.)- use them.

"Since there are so many different circumstances and scenarios behind the pregnancy and the choice to abort, each should be examined individually. 

I am generally pro-choice, but I have shifted my position from being allowed to abort upon request to being allowed to abort under extenuating/appropriate/justifiable circumstances. 

All cases involving rape victims and overall health of the woman and the offspring shouldn't even be subject to debate. Pro-life and religious fanatics don't seem to care about these matters, they just want more children because they 'belong to god and we need more church members'.

In cases where health matters are not a concern, there needs to be at least some formal processes that evaluate the woman's reasons, and it should at least be consensual between both parents (that is, assuming the father did not just walk off and wants nothing to do with the woman). I cannot rationalize it when both parents are on opposite ends of the spectrum, and a decision is made against the other parent's will (they both bear the responsibility in my opinion). 

As for cases where they're not ready for this (assuming no health concerns or conflicts among the parents decision exists), life is full of things that we did not want or did not want it now, but often times we have to step up and deal with it. 

I maintain my position on being pro-choice, and that it should remain legal, but I'd call for tighter regulations and criteria for qualifying, as well as provision of support services (social and financial) post-birth to ensure that the newborns are in the hands of good and suitable parents.",,,,[2],
"You are killing a living thing. And many of the same people that support abortion defend animals killed. What is the difference? You are killing something alive.

However, the government should not be aiding programs that do abortions. I am sure many people around the country don't want to pay for the death of a child.",,,,[16],
Aborting a baby is murder. That is another person's life you're taking away. This should not be legal. You should not be able to abort a baby just because you do not want to care for it. That baby has feelings and a heart beat meaning it also has the basic human rights to life.,,,,[16],

Abortion is so wrong! That is murder. Don't say a fetus isn't alive because it is it is breathing and is a living being.

It has a right to the pursuit if happiness, and to life. Doesn't a beating heart make it alive? Aren't brain waves a indication of life? It has it's rights and who is the mother to decide for the baby, an independent human. The baby has done nothing wrong, completely innocent.

If I went to my mothers garden and snipped all the sprouted flowers off and told her, ""Oh those aren't flowers because they are not fully grown"", she would not be very happy because guess what?

"First of all it is rather ironic that individuals say that abortion saves lives. Stem cell research was originally done using the ambilical cord and made a lot of advancement there, but of course this was when abortion was illegal. If stem cells can be researched with out killing a fetus then why do it? The whole fetus not being alive thing is entirely ridiculous. Yes if it were removed from the womb and layed on a table it would die. The same as if a 3 month old baby were layed on a table would die. If it has to be KILLED then it is ALIVE. I had a friend who was much older than me that had an abortion done at around the same time I was born. One day this friend of mine looked at me and said ""he could have been a boy, he could have had a girlfriend like you and liked to play baseball like you, he could have went to college and done something with his life, but I ended that for him, I made that decision myself."" She then cried for a small while. Whoever in this world said anyone had the right to choose whether or not someone could live or die before their life even started? You sick monsters who stand behind some scientific bulwark and pretend that it's no big deal to cut out a fetus. Be ashamed of yourselves, learn from your mistake and fix this.

Abortion
I know that abortion as a constitutional right proves false due to one of the commandment. The fifth commandment says you shall not murder and abortion equals to murder. Some will say, ‘It's not alive until birth.’ That is certainly not true! A human is a human when it is made not at birth. Why would any living soul want to kill a helpless little human that cannot defend itself from the harm coming its way. It's not even old enough to understand pain, yet it goes through so much pain that it kills them. To that I just say… what the heck! It's like walking up to your 5 year old and killing it because you don't want them anymore so just slice slice done don't have to deal with you anymore! That's just, mind my saying,   stupid - insanely stupid! It’s unremarkably stupid and sad that that child, that miniature human being will never see the light of day, their mothers face, they would never grow up, have kids of their own, or have a real family and life. When you abort a baby you take a helpless life that just sits there...Wondering, ‘What's going on? Why are they doing this? Why are my parents letting them?’ You kill your child. You take away happiness and sadness and all other feelings and experiences. You are a murderer. And you should carry that guilt and shame to the grave saying, ‘Why did I do that to that innocent human being?’ Even if you're not ready or can't give them what they need, there is always a second option. Give them a fighting chance at a good life at a good adoption home. There is always another option and never any reason to resort to death, because people are people no matter how big, how small, white or black, tall or thin, baby or elder… a person is a person and they have feelings whether you admit to it or not.",,,,[16],
"We hear so much about the right of a woman, she did not have to get pregnant.  That was her choice.  The baby has a right to live.  I don't understand why everyone advocates murder in this country.

"It is why women should have weapons to protect themselves from rapists and pedophiles. Its a disgusting course of action to end a little human's life, does that unborn child have no rights? Can he or she not live? Why not give it away for adoption, to someone would could possibly care? Now I can understand the case of the mother's life being endangered by the child, yes that is acceptable, but when someone who has is conceiving a child is able to give birth to a healthy child, then it would be ridiculous and extremely sad to take their lives away. I am against abortion, I am pro-life.",,,,[16],

"So with all you people saying abortion is okay and it's saves more lives than takes, if someone needs stem cells, they have to kill to get them. If it grows it is alive. I dare all of you pro abortion people to define it without words involving death. You can't because you have to kill a fetus for it to be aborted. And to everyone who says fetuses are not humans, they are just as human as us, they just have not been squeezed out yet. Abortionists are murderers. You are killing innocent life for you're own benefit. Even in cases of fatality or rape or incest etc., that baby in there is innocent life that grows and thinks. You are not giving the thing a chance to live. That is horrible. All life has value. Rape, incest etc. fetuses are no less valuable than a regular one. If nature does not want it to exist, then it will take care if it. All of you pro abortionists have no place to declare who lives and who dies. Let fate be fate and don't deny an innocent baby it's true fate.",,,,[16],
"Murder Definition: the crime of unlawfully killing a person especially with malice aforethought (http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/murder).

So is abortion murder? Is a fetus a human being? Yes. In fact, the moment human life begins IS at conception. Don't believe me? The medical field seems to support my view (http://thechart.blogs.cnn.com/2011/11/07/medical-views-when-does-human-life-begin/). To further support my reasoning, we can all agree that a baby is a human. That baby was human at the time of birth, which means that it must have been human 5 minutes before the birth. So if the baby is a human before birth, then that means that it is a human while it is a fetus. If it is a human while it’s a fetus, then it wouldn't matter if the growing fetus were nine months, nine weeks, or nine days old, it is still human.

Now that we established that the fetus is a human, let’s take a look at what these arguments made by the pro-abortionist look like when we substitute the unborn baby with a two-year-old, since both are human.

Killing two-year-olds can actually save the world by reducing the increasing overpopulation!

It is the mother’s choice to kill the two-year-old, nobody can tell her otherwise!

The innocent two-year-old should be killed because of the crimes of his/her father.

If the woman cannot provide for and raise the two-year-old (as if adoption is out of the picture) then she has the right to kill it.

Women should have the right to choose whether or not to kill two-year-olds!

Killing two-year-olds should be legal!

If the two-year-old is not given the best chance possible to live a good life, then it would be a moral service to kill him/her.

If war (even waged to prevent the rise of mass genocide and global terrorism) is so widely accepted, then why isn’t killing two-year-olds?

If we are allowed to kill animals, then why not kill two-year-olds?

If the two-year-old is unconscious, then it is OK to kill him/her!

The two-year-old should die because of a poor decision made by his/her parents.

Because a woman has to endure sufferings of life (periods, pain), then the two-year-old should be killed!

Because the woman thinks that the two-year-old would not live a good life, he/she should be killed.

Who are you to try to keep a woman from killing a two-year-old, you immoral and inconsiderate person!

The parents don’t want the two-year-old, so it is ok to kill it.

I hardly think that anyone in their right mind, especially the law, would support the killing of toddlers under any circumstance, so why is an unborn child any different? Probably the most leading argument for abortion is the possibility of pregnancy by rape. While yes, it is possible, and sadly does happen, honestly, does it happen often enough that killing a child should be legalized for everyone? Let’s pull some numbers.

Sadly, 1/6 American Women are or will be rape victims (http://www.rainn.org/get-information/statistics/sexual-assault-victims), but that also reduces the percentage down to a rounded 17 percent of women.

So with 83 percent of the woman population excluded how many actually get pregnant from rape? Some studies have shown numbers as high as a rounded eight percent will get pregnant, while others show lower numbers such as 3.1 to five percent (http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/health/2012/08/21/todd-akin-challenged-by-doctors-on-rape-and-pregnancy/). Once again, I will give the benefit of a doubt and go with the rounded eight percent, which leaves us with 1.36 percent of all women will be pregnant by rape, hopefully even much lower than that. 

While rape is a sad issue, it still does not justify the murder of an innocent child. Plus, even if abortion were to be legalized for the sake of rape victims, then that would enable the other 98.64 percent of the women population to kill the unborn child for any of the other reasons previously mentioned.

Besides, studies have once again shown that the main motives behind abortion are not because of rape after all, as pro-abortionists make it out to be. Allow me to quote some statistics from a study on these motives;

“The results showed that more than half of the women expressed that a bad relationship with the partner in one way or another was a motive for the abortion. Other important motives included characteristics of the women and their partners, mainly immaturity, work/studies and unsuitable life situation for having a child. Less common motives seemed to be economy, dwelling and medical and health factors.” http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8038886

So is abortion really all about the rape victims, or the not responsible teenagers and bad relationships with the man that will be the motives behind all the unjustifiable and numerous counts of murders against helpless and innocent babies? Besides, government was our nation not built on the idea that everybody (including the unborn) should have rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness?

"A single cell is living. We all probably know this fact. As soon as sperm cell meet egg cell, they produce a secondary cell which has a life.

Sometimes circumstances surrounding pregnancy are tragic. The woman was raped perhaps or maybe the baby has been diagnosed with the defect.However, a tragedy is not answered with another.We do not erase rape by killing a child. We do not cure a baby by taking away his   life.

Regardless of rape, incest or any other factor doesn't make a person lesser human. 

Women who have been raped must compassionately care for. But it doesn't include excluding a woman;s child, does it?

Often time's people saying that they are not ready to take care of a child which is perhaps true in a lot of cases. But there are millions of couples in the world that cannot have a baby but would love to. Adoption is the living and moral alternative to abortion.",,,,[16],
Abortion should be illegal because your killing a human being. Why kill them ? They should be able to live life and enjoy it not get killed just because your not ready to be a parent or because other reasons people might have. The baby you are expecting has the right to live.,,,,[16],
"Think about it. Is a baby really any different then an animal? If you thinking aborting a fetus that doesn't even have a conscience is so wrong, then it is also equally wrong to slaughter animals by that logic. I'm pretty sure most people here who said no eats meat right? Then your a horrible person. :p",,,,[16],
"It's hard to put into words how morally and physically wrong it is to have an abortion. Let's just get out of the way first that a fetus has been scientifically proven to be a living thing from the moment it is conceived. So when a mother- and I say mother because though the child may not be born, it is a child- goes into a clinic and has an abortion, she is killing a living thing. Say she also has a one year-old child as well. As far as 'life' is concerned, killing the one year-old child is on par with killing the unborn child. Because, as with the fetus, the one year-old is still a potential life, something that is still developing and is yet to make an impact on the wider world. Most people would look at that, the idea of killing a young child, and be revolted. They would go up in arms against the mother for murder, and she would go to prison. That is because it is unanimously decided that killing a living child is horrific and disgusting. For some unimaginably bizarre reason, people defend the legality of a 'hidden murder', where a mother kills a helpless child that is inside her. The reasons for doing so are many, and I understand that things such as rape and even inconvenience can be extremely difficult to deal with, but there are other ways around it, and mothers should not be so quick to give up their status as a mother and murder a child. There is absolutely no reason in which a person should be able to decide whether another person lives or dies, and I challenge anyone to try and prove otherwise.",,,,[16],
"If human rights apply to every human then how can they not apply to a human embryo/fetus which is inarguably human.   I believe in women's rights but not when they take away the rights of another.

There is no question a fetus is alive, no question it is human they just can't fight for their rights which is why we need to. I believe in a woman's right to choose multiple forms of birth control or abstinence not murder.",,,,[16],
It is harmful to all babies because they dont get a shot at life .And they dont get a chance to do thing in the world or get to find the women they marry which is said for them the they cant get a shot at being who would want to be,,,,[16],
"A fetus is a living human being, and should be treated like one.   It's a shame that people care more about so called ""rights"" than the life of a human being. An unborn child has no voice.   It has no chance.   It has no say.   If a baby is killed accidentally it's called a miscarriage, but if it's killed legally its called abortion. How sad it is that anyone would support the murder of innocent human beings.",,,,[16],
"Except for these circumstances, most of abortions are from teenagers and women who think it's ok to go around having meaningless sex with people who they aren't   married to. It's absolutely disgusting to see women with loose morals spreading diseases and killing their unwanted children. I don't know why these people can't understand that having sex is a sacred act, and that they should be joyful they are capable of having children instead of letting THEIR OWN CHILD be pulled apart and removed from their womb. Many people are the children of women and men who had wished they had aborted. Having grown up, how would they feel knowing THEIR OWN PARENTS had wanted them to be butchered before birth?",,,,[16],
"Many people believe the baby does not really exist until it is outside of its mother. This makes me sick! There are plenty of stories of babies surviving abortions. You know why babies can survive an abortion, because they are more than just tissue inside there mothers, they are living human beings. Some of these accounts of abortion survivors are babies as young as 5 months old. I would like to see people who believe the baby is just tissue meet a child who was born early. Can you say that child was just tissue? No! It is a real human being. 93% of mothers regret their abortions. You know why, because they know it is wrong. Abortion is wrong, it is the killing of another human being.",,,,[16],
"The question is not whether or not abortion should be illegal. The question is whether it is wrong, morally. It saddens me sometimes how there are so few secular arguments against abortion, which I find to be a horrifying decision. I have never, and never will given that I am male, born the pain of childbirth but nevertheless it is still a decision that will kill a unique individual. People claim that a fetus is not a person, per se, but it is a fetus with its own DNA, a future. It is morally justifiable at times, such as for a rape victim or in cases where the mother's health is at risk. But that is simply taking the lesser of two evils, and abortion in and of itself is still wrong, from a secular point of view.",,,,[16],
"What is wrong with you liberals?   ""They might have a good reason"" ""A fetus cant live on their own"" That makes me sick. 

I hope you know that on the 5th week, Fetuses start growing. As quoted by mayoclinic : ""The fifth week of pregnancy, or the third week after conception, marks the beginning of the embryonic period. This is when the baby's brain, spinal cord, heart and other organs begin to form. The embryo is now made of three layers."" That means the fetus is alive, but doesn't notice it. Human beings develop at an astonishingly rapid pace. Today, parents can see the development of their children with their own eyes. The obstetric ultra-sound done typically at 20 weeks gestation provides not only pictures but a real-time video of the active life of the child in the womb: clasping his hands, sucking his thumb, yawning, stretching, getting the hiccups, covering his ears to a loud sound nearby -- even smiling. And onto the ""good reason"" bit. Sure, lets say you get sexually assaulted. Have the baby, then give it to adoption. At least there you would be able to give it life instead of not even letting it have a chance. 

What if it was you?",,,,[16],
"Try looking from other perspective. How about if you are the fetus. What will you feel if you were killed even when you are not born yet. If you think you want it maybe you should try it first, then if it doesn't hurt, you could make it legal. I conclude that making abortion legal is not an option.",,,,[16],
"How would you feel if you were aborted? You wouldn't feel anything cause you wouldn't exist. Then you have all these people saying ""I heart boobies!"" Well my friends abortion increases breast cancer risks by 200%.",,,,[16],
"What is the point of fighting for human rights if f you can not fight for your right of having a life.
That is what I personally think. Yes, there are some exceptions, like If a mother got raped and she does not want to have a baby. It is not her fault. If the baby will have a problem in the birth and both will die, that would be acceptable since you would be saving a life;
or, in cases of incest.",,,,[16],
"In today’s society, people have been made to think that abortion is not murder, but because the Catholic Church and some of the risks of getting an abortion, hopefully people will change their minds, even in the case of incest or rape.   A baby is alive at the moment that the sperm and the egg meet, therefor you are killing a person in an abortion.",,,,[16],
"Between 20 to 24 weeks the foetus is really quite advanced in terms of its nervous system- Professor Stuart Campbell, ultrasound pioneer
Some believe that having an abortion will solve problems and it may in the immediate surrounding circumstances. Eg. Going to college may be easier, you may not have to break it to your parents etc. But whose fault is that? In reality, what if your family understood and accepted you and you still managed to get through college ? If not, there’s always the choice of putting the child up for adoption The truth is better than a lie if it costs a person’s life
Abortion just hides the problem through the murder of an innocent being
Just because it’s legal does not make it right, just because it’s hidden doesn’t mean the emotional scarring will disappear.
Choosing abortion, this denies the life of a child who already exists, why is murder wrong and abortion not, if they are the same thing?",,,,[16],
"Whether abortion should is legal or not boils down to one question:   What is the fetus.     Science has shown us that the fetus is a living person.   Just because they are small and inside the womb does not mean they are not alive.       If you that is true, then a four year old in a small closet could be killed,   because they are small and enclosed in a tiny space.     This murder of innocent people has to stop.",,,,[16],
"Intent tends to shape how we view a child. For example, When a mother wants to give birth and raise the child, It is considered a ""baby. "" However, When a mother wants an abortion, It is no longer a ""baby"" and instead a ""fetus. "" Neither classification is technically wrong, However, It implies that a child is not really human before it is born. This is scientifically false. Children deserve the same human rights that they receive after birth as they do before birth. Of course, In the cases where the life of the mother are in danger or rape, That is an incredibly difficult decision and the mother should be allowed to opt for an abortion in these situations. However, For the majority of abortions, That are performed out of convenience to the mother, Are amoral. Just think if convenience was considered an adequate justification for murdering your kid after he/she was born. . . .",,,,[16],
"The abortion taking place in our society today can largely be compared to that of Hitler and what he did to the Jews. What did the Jews do to be killed? They did nothing but were killed for being Jews. Why are we killing babies? They are the most innocent things we have, and it is only fair to give them a chance in this life.",,,,[16],
"Yes if your remove the baby at 15 weeks it will not survive. Nor would a child that is 3 months old. Both of the baby need their mothers to survive and prosper and it is in the constitutional persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.",,,,[16],
"Yes, it's wrong.  It's wrong to take the life of an innocent human being.  Abortion takes the life of an innocent human being.  Therefore, abortion is wrong.  It really is as simple as that.  And it's silly to suggest the unborn are anything but human beings.  They have human DNA, their parents are human, and if they aren't killed, they will go through every stage of human development--embryo, fetus, infant, child, adolescent, adult.",,,,[16],
"Everyone has the right to be born and to live a life. I feel that women that abort are killers and just think of themselves, its killing an innocent little human being that has no fault of anyyyything! And shouldn't pay what every price for your consequences. Its so sad. I dont even know how some women do that!!! If you abort you are a killerrrr of an innocent little unborn baby. And remember it has a beating heart since the first day in your tummy!!",,,,[16],
"The act of killing is wrong. Even if the victim is yet to be born. The government has stated that a baby that is still in the womb is alive and is a human being, and when you kill a human being you are a murder.
Abortion should be outlawed in all states and should have never been created in the first place.",,,,[16],
"All abortion is and will ever be, Baby killing. It is not ""my body, My choice"". It is the fetus's right to be born. Why should we even kill children. They are our future. Plus, If you want to be a whore, Use protection, You whores. That is all I am going to say",,,,[16],
"A human being's life begins at fertilization.   Zygote, embryo, fetus, newborn, toddler, child, teenager, adult, elderly - these are all stages in the life-cycle of a human being. Location of the human being shouldn't matter - all innocent human beings should have a basic right to life. No one should be killed simply because they are unwanted or inconvenient.",,,,[16],
"What makes murder inherently wrong is that it deprives an individual of the meaningful future it will have. Quite clearly, if I am in a coma and will awaken from it someday and have a meaningful future, it is wrong to kill me, since you are unjustly snatching away all the future moments which I will enjoy.

So the primary ""wrong making property"" of murder is that it deprives a being of a FLO (future like ours).

But fetuses are individuals which most certainly do have a FLO. Even if the fetus isn't ""conscious"" it's still a member of the human species, and has a meaningful future just like ours.

Thus, it is immoral, since it is immoral to unjustly deny a being of its meaningful future.",,,,[16],
"I think that abortion is a terrible thing. If a mother who is pregnant in any stage is killed, it is counted as the murder of 2 people. Why should abortions be considered any differently? It is a form of murder. You are killing children who never get to live.",,,,[16],
"The Assyrian Codex in 1100 B.C. Stated that abortion was punishable by impalement. Persian law in 600 B.C. Called abortion willful murder.

Note what Josephus, in his histories of the Jews, states concerning abortion, ""The law orders all the offspring to be brought up, and forbids woman either to cause abortion or to make away with the fetus, a woman convicted of this is regarded as an infanticide because she destroys a soul and diminishes the race."" 

The United States is a country where 5,500 abortion clinics abort 30% of all pregnancies. In our nation's capital there are three abortions performed for every one live birth, and this is not uncommon. Since 1980 abortions have outnumbered live births in 18 metropolitan areas of the United States. The shame of this problem is reflected in the statistic that 99% of all abortions are performed on demand. This means that the only prerequisite that is demanded of the mother is her desire to rid herself of the developing fetus. For years we have heard the cry that if abortions were abolished, ""What would happen to the woman who finds herself in the position of having been raped, involved in incest, has a severe fetal deformity, or her life is at stake?"" The way this argument is presented leads one to believe that abortions are here because of such cases. However, let us not blind you with the facts! Only 1% of the abortions performed annually in this country are for rape, incest, fetal deformity, or the mother's health. Many believe that the percentage is even smaller than this. Let us note a fact concerning pregnancy in the case of rape or incest. ""The case of rape and incest is really a non-issue because of its rare occurrence. It is estimated that in 5,000 to 10,000 rapes, only one pregnancy will result. In a typical US city with a population of 500,000 that would be one case every 10 to 20 years!""

 There are at least five major procedures that are used to terminate an unwanted pregnancy. (1) The vacuum suction method. ""The vacuum is so powerful that the baby is instantly broken up into a fluid mass of blood, tissue, and cartilage."" (2) The cutting up method. ""The doctor just slices the baby into pieces inside the womb of the mother. The skull is crushed with the concepts to reduce its size for the withdrawal."" (3) The surgical method. ""The abdomen of the mother is surgically opened and the baby removed. The baby is then either used in experiments or else burned or drowned in water."" (4) The Saline Method. ""A salt solution is injected into her amniotic sac where the baby is literally burned to death -in effect pickling the baby. The baby may thrash about for a few moments, but soon it becomes perfectly still and dies.",,,,[16],
"So many people in the world think that it it is okay to have an abortion because, ""the embryo is not a human life yet"", or ""it is the woman's choice."" I do not believe that those are good reasons why you should be allowed to have an abortion.



Do you think that babies, that have already been born, are cute? You probably do. Do you want to know why? Well I will tell you, we humans think that babies are cute, because they are our offspring and we need to take care of our offspring. would you kill an already born baby? NO, you wouldn't! 



Secondly, babies are humans and embryos are babies. It is against the law to kill a human, so why is it legal to kill a baby?



I agree with BlackSand in that the woman knew that it was a possibility and I don't think that she should be able to havea way out, ""you get what you get"" and whatnot",,,,[16],
"Life is now defined as beginning at conception. Therefore, killing a fetus is killing life. With that said, the mother, making the choice, and the doctor, performing the abortion, are murderers.   Murder is punished through our legal system, and murderers are either given the death penalty, or life in prison. However, mothers simply pay a fine, and move on with only guilt. Doctors get paid to do it. Doctors get paid to murder. How is that acceptable by any means?",,,,[16],
"If you see a fetus or even embryo in the womb it can do so much, so young. My first scan with my first son he was 15 weeks and was somersaulting and moving about so much. Definitely the starts of a person. My 2nd son at 14 weeks was sucking his thumb and yawning and kicking about. Two different personalities already emerging from within before birth. My eldest is a rebel and my youngest quiet and laid back. You could tell that from the first scans. I believe life is life even before birth.",,,,[16],
"There is no reason to kill a human being no matter the consequences you get from it. You are the one responsible for being impregnated you have the responsibility for taking care of the child NOT KILLING IT. No matter if you being impregnated was based on rape, a one night stand, or you can not handle it. THERE IS NO REASON TO KILL A HUMAN BEING. They have just as much right to live as you do.",,,,[16],
Who cares about woman right to choose it should be baby right to choose because all it is is murder and killing they kill more babies than hitler killed people and it should be stopped all they want is to have sex and get rid of the evidence and everything.,,,,[16],
"A while ago, a woman decided to drive her car into a body of water, committing suicide for herself and two kids, and everyone thinks it's a big deal, but is it really any different than all the abortions that happen every day? Really, I think that we are covertly breaking our own laws.",,,,[16],
Any form of mankind should protect man kind and life wherever possible. It is unfair knowing someone killed a innocent baby from your own mistakes. You are practically murdering a baby so you can live your life but you will always have that guilt of knowing you murdered and took away a little person that is half you. Every baby deserves a chance at life and every mother should give their baby that chance and make it as best as they can for them as the possibly can,,,,[16],
"The very term ""fetus"" is latin for ""unborn child"". Fancy wording does not change what it is. When an abortion is performed, both child and mother are affected. More women who talk about their abortions claim that they are still haunted by the choice they made. My question for those who support abortion- why is it man-slaughter on two counts when a pregnant woman is killed and the baby dies as a result while abortion is considered a choice?",,,,[16],
"As a big blob of cells speaking here, I must say that the smaller blobs of cells in the womb of a mother has the same worth as me. 

But, you may protest, why should we consider something without a heartbeat human life? I don't know, maybe the fact that we were all something that small at some point. What do you think that thing is going to grow into? A plant? A dog? At every point during pregnancy, the child contains human DNA and is growing and developing. Seems enough to me to consider that life.

Abortion is murder, no two ways about it.",,,,[16],
"As stated before, abortion is murder. A fetus, like a human, has a pumping heart, eyes, organs, a brain, etc. etc. What doesn't make it a child (human being), that all matters to the person, although everyone has their own preferences. Yes, abortion is wrong, why must it be debated at all?",,,,[16],
"Even though abortion supposedly ""controls the population"", we've got enough of that with all of the fires and killings that happen every day.   We don't need women killing off their future children because they did not want to be on the pill.   However, it would be a totally different story if she were to be raped or kidnapped, but if she brought this on herself, she should keep that child.   It isn't right to take someones life because of your own selfish acts.   Most people say that it ISN'T murder because it ""just a little ball of cells in your stomach"" but it is way more than just that.   Once you find out that you're pregnant, that thing inside you is already alive.   It's already growing.   If it wasn't, it wouldn't be growing would it?
I din't think it is right to take a life because people are too lazy to face the consequences of having a child when they mess up.",,,,[16],
For you older people you know that it's not right. These are living breathing people and they deserve to live because it's not THEIR fault for making you pregnant. You were the one who messed up. Those kids that were aborted will never be able to live on the good earth that we do if we don't do something about this!,,,,[16],
"Abortion is bad because it denied a child rights to life and under the human rights law, every child have the right to life so why abuse such rights when you were given yours at the time of your birth? Lets give every child their rights no to it!!!1 k",,,,[16],
"Canada is now one of the few countries in the Western world that does not have any legal restrictions on abortions. In my opinion, I see abortion as an act of murder to the most defenseless, an unborn baby. Many people argue women are stripped from their rights if abortion were to be illegal because it is their body. However, the body suffering the most is not actually theirs; it is the baby that they are killing. Often time’s people say that they are not ready to take care of a child which is true in a lot of cases. There are millions of couples in the world that cannot have a baby but would love to. Adoption is the living and moral alternative to abortion. In Canada, abortions are publicly funded through taxpayers; whether they agree with abortion or not. If anything, abortion clinics should not be publicly funded. Canada needs, at the very least, some restrictions on abortion.",,,,[16],
"Abortion is murder. It's killing another human being.They have feelings, they have heartbeats. The woman should have been careful or else she wouldn't have gotten pregnant. The child is as much human as anyone else. Abortion is unsafe and can kill the child if not than both the mother and child.",,,,[16],
"If you get pregnant, and you did not mean to, you should still give that child a chance. Yes, when you abort the baby it may not even be a baby yet, but how would you feel if your mother took away your only chance to live. Your mother decided for you, you get no chance. How is that fair? Every living creature deserves a chance, never should a mother take the chance for an amazing person to never be known. my mom did not want me, if she did not have me, I would never get my chance to show people I can be someone, and I will be someone. so think about the future your taking away from your unborn child. Then walk out of that clinic.",,,,[16],
"Live is what? - an atom a cell - yes that is life - look how the universe was created - when we find a trace or particle of dust, water..Etc in outer space - what do the head lines read! - Live found in space.

So how is a live that can breath, move and feel not alive? ... Yes the body needs support to live - all begging live does. 

If you got into an accident and need live support, how would you feel/react if the doctors say na he/she is not a person, he cant help him/her self -   lets suck, rip, smash him/her apart while he watches us do this to him/her.

I find it outrageous that so called ""people"" on the top of the food chain in the whole known universe still kill off there own kind, no other species does this - in fact they do the opposite - protect and love.

If you think its okay and no problem think of this - back 150- 300 years you would of been though of as a beast, murder, evil and corrupt and sick minded.

What changed - nothing! Except us, people feeling pity on our own pour selfs. We don't look, or think twice anymore - only if its beneficial to our selfs and we can profit and grow. We don't think of each other as a group but only as selfish-beings . Yes you can counter this - but just think about the world we live in and how we live it.

"Abortion is murdering an innocent child. Even if it is not born yet, it is still a person. Abortions are simply UNCONSTITUTIONAL. Yes, a woman has the right to control her body, but not the life of someone else. Would you murder a toddler? If no, then why murder a child which is not born? It is the same thing. Even if you were raped, then you should not kill the child, you should at least have someone adopt it.",,,,[16],
"We now know that a newly conceived baby is just as much a life as you or I. You cannot debate that fact. What is debatable is the good nature of humans since so many of us seem to think it's okay to kill lives just because these lives don't ""matter."" We think that their lives are ours to manipulate because we convince ourselves of the lie we have been lead to believe. We think that if this life has not made an impact on the world, then it won't matter if he or she doesn't. Since when is it okay to kill the lives we have selected as ones that don't matter? Well, they all matter because of who they are. They are humans. When we kill other humans we go against our own humanity. We are not animals. We are more than that. We are humans with souls who need to rise above primitive means of living. Don't kill babies. You are not a gerbil.",,,,[16],
"Abortion is killing of the most innocent people, The littlest children. A fetus is a separate organism, A human fetus is a human being.

Peter Singer) who want to allow killing born babies), Then a bigger and bigger child and finally an adult who has the same rights as other adults.",,,,[16],
"Abortions should only be exercised when the mother is in clear danger of holding the child. Rape victims? The fetus that is a product of rape don't know any better, they're no different than a child   conceived from wedlock or marriage.
