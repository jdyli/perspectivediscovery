247	Everybody says that abortion is wrong because it is murdering a living being. What people forget about abortion when it is performed is that the fetus is not yet alive. Most abortions are usually done within the first trimester, when the fetus has barely developed. A being cannot have self-sustaining until the brain has fully developed, and you can't kill something that isn't even alive. I feel that this debate is too important on the issue of women's rights to even consider that the religious argument should hold any weight in this debate, so I will not respond to any of the religious arguments. In the end, if you don't like abortion, don't have an abortion.	(27.548030013698966)
160	Many make the claim that abortion is murder because it's killing living cells. If that's the case, then men commit genocide every time they masturbate, as they're killing several thousands of living sperm cells; women are committing murder every time they have their periods, as they're flushing a living egg. People commit murder when they exfoliate their face as they're killing millions of living skin cells. If you're going to make the argument that it's murder because you're killing living cells, then you're a murder by your own right.	(26.16940265526151)
354	We MUST be mature enough to know when is the right time to have sex. If you did have sex, abortion is not the solution and we must face the consequences of our actions. Ending the life of the fetus also can cause diseases, and the damage of reproductive system, which later may not be able to bear another child.	(23.686778028081914)

If a young girl was possibly impregnated by her very own father or older sibling then she should get an abortion. A friend of mine asked me "" If a girl was pregnant by her boyfriend shouldn't the boyfriend get a choice"" I think no. A woman's body is her own. We aren't slaves for men it's the 21st century for god sake. Also people keep bringing religion into it. If that's your religion then go ahead and have your raper's baby. I believe in a woman's choice and that's all i gotta say"	(22.355256604307776)
595	It's the person who is having a baby to decide whether or not they can support and raise the baby. Of course there is always foster care, but thousands of children are sitting there waiting for that day when someone comes along and loves them and in most cases that day never comes. So what's worse for a child... sitting in a foster home waiting and wanting love from someone or never existing? Never having to experience the pain of nobody loving them? Call me heartless but i know for a fact that if I got pregnant and i knew I couldn't support it, I would get an abortion... not because I was too lazy and what not, because I would have enough respect to end the babies sorrow and hatred towards me before it even began!

324	When two adults make the choice to participate in an activity known to create babies, these adults must accept responsibility. Responsibility should not be avoided at the cost of an innocent child's life. Some people believe that having an abortion will solve their problems. In immediate present, it may appear that the problems have been erased. In reality, abortion only hides problems, it doesn't solve them.	(20.781896193533065)

297	Why should you kill a baby that you made. It's the peoples fault because they really think that   having sex will make them feel good but   killing a baby while   it's still producing that's just   fucking wrong.

252	"A fetus is not a conscious being. In certain circumstances, Abortion would be more humane. The argument of abortion isn't so one-sided where you can just say EVERY abortion is wrong to ban it or make it a punishable crime. You can't stop people from doing what they want. You can only push them into more dangerous situations because of your constant ""I NEED TO CONTROL EVERYTHING EVERYONE DOES"" type of mindset. How about you control your own life."

150	Abortion is not murder. See, the thing is, a heartbeat does not mean you are alive. Life is determined by electroencephalogram (EEG). If you have lost EEG, this means you are 'brain dead', which is the legal and scientific definition of death. Therefore, by legal definition, a fetus CANNOT be murdered, due to the lack of EEG, it can only be removed. Sorry pro-fetus people, but this is all scientifically accurate.	(44.35455375221473)

369	"LISTEN! Ninety-three percent of the abortions in America are for convenience. The mother's health is an issue only three percent of the time, and the baby's health is an issue only three percent of the time. Rape or incest are issues only one percent of the time. Ninety-three percent of all abortions in America are performed just because someone doesn't want a child! Besides, there IS adoption, or (the old fashion way) if you can't bear to go through adoption stuff, you can leave the child at someone's door step! Still, you should give the child at least a chance to LIVE! My mother was a single mother, and God (and other people, if you don't want to bring up Religion) has provided the needs for her to care for four children! Now I am an adult, but I still look up to her and thank her (who was once FLAT BROKE!) for not getting that abortion and for caring for me. My sisters became pregnant (one against her will, and the other became pregnant TWICE) and neither of them chose abortion! I'm not trying to ""condemn"" people who have, but trying to help them. Besides, your baby is like apart of you, and it would be scary to have to go through taking that away from you. I say keep yourself from the pain of going through that, but instead give yourself the joy of a new life! I know that some people can't afford it, but there are RESOURCES out there! Not to mention if you ASK someone. Still, when it comes to mom and dad, don't do anything stupid. You shouldn't have done that mistake in the first place (although it happens), and yes, if you were rapped, they will understand! Well, unless you have a um... Mother or father who has a different perspective, then that is a problem that must be figured out, but you will get through it one way or another!

The life that lives inside of you is your creation and it was a choice you made when you decided to spread your legs. If you think after getting pregnant, "" I have my whole life ahead of me!"", well there's adoption. There's plenty of couples that want to have children, and assholes that abort their babies are making it hard on those couples to even find a child to call their own.   So stop murdering your babies."	(38.05135310930661)

The only people who should legally be able to have an abortion are people that have been raped.

344	"The whole ""my body my choice"" is ridiculous. These women who have gone and had sex and gotten themselves pregnant and decide to get an abortion are being selfish. That little person inside of you, whether you are 16 weeks or a week pregnant, does not have a choice. They can't tell you anything. As a mother, whether you have already had the child or are getting ready to have the child, you have to give everything to your child to make sure they grow up strong and   have the best shot at life as they can. By getting an abortion, you are taking away their right to live and are more concerned about yourself than you are of them. Way to go you selfish people."	(68.45292527023415)
357	Yes, You have a choice to have an abortion. Although you have the choice it does not always mean that that is the best choice that you can possible chose. You should prepare for the risky situations before you even get there. Also if you think that getting rid of a child that is growing inside of your body is a good thing for you to do, I feel bad for you. If we just call the child a bunch of cells that are being formed into the shape of a living and breathing child, Then I don't know what this world is coming to! Just imagine if every one stopped having children, Because they did not want the child to get in their way of their pursuit of happiness. This whole world would cease to exist and everyone would die along with it. We must think about the consequences of our choices before we make these choices. We must think about what would happen before we make a choice that could alter the rest of our lives, Either for the better or for the worse we must sit down and think about the consequences. You have the choice either way you can choose life and responsibility, Or you can choose death and our so called pursuit of happiness. I hope that next time you choose you carefully weigh out the options. That's all I have to say. I hope you choose wisely and think about the lifelong consequences of both options.	(61.4379709541249)
395	Sometimes people can not use morality or religion when it comes to such a controversial issue. I am a Christian but I have to take a look at reality here. There are many teenagers getting pregnant and they are children themselves so why should they be forced to take care of a child ? A child is not a part time job. A woman has to dedicate her time to raising a kid with a healthy sense of self worth and values. Some women do not have a lot of money and having a child would only complicate things. I come from a single parent household and I see the way that my mother struggles. I feel so sorry for her. I see so many women in this state. Women need to have kids when they are good and ready. And that means hopefully with a husband and a good job to take care of them. Children can grow up damaged from having parents that never wanted them in the first place. Why should a child live with knowing they were unwanted by the people that gave birth to them. This goes for adopted children as well. They will always want to know where they came from and why their parents gave them away. I say avoid all of this pain and get the ,abortion. Let's be honest here, some people should not be parents. It is that simple.	(38.09088117174387)

522	Women should not be forced to have children they dont want and cant take care of. Many mothers with plans would forever regret the child for the rest of their lives and that is unfair to the child. I was raped by an ex boyfriend and if he had made me pregnant I would never have wanted to keep a child that was created as a result of that and him but adoption would not have been an option as I couldnt have faced having my child not with me. Abortion means that women have the option to make sure they get it right. And you can never say just have safe sex as no method of contraception involving surgery is 100 percent effective. I have had miscarriages on the pill. Let women have the choice to have a child when they are ready not because of a mistake or an accident.	(33.74818826429093)

15	Because it is HORRIBLE. You are killing an innocent child for your wrong action. I get it if you were sexually assaulted, that still doesn't mean you should kill an infant. Putting the child up for adoption is a much better decision. Abortion is also against God's word, and his plans for that child. What if God wanted that child to grow up to cure cancer? That makes you feel bad doesn't it? Well it should if you think killing an innocent little child is okay.	(33.4978921906406)
360	"First of all, an unborn baby is should still be considered ""living"" as it can feel real and intense pain which could in fact be even more intense than pain of a born child, after just 8 weeks from conception. Unborn babies have also been proven to have real emotions and when are aborted endure a horribly scary and painful death. People should have to live with the consequences of their actions and if they don't then we are teaching Americans to be not responsible. Also, if that is really all to much for the parents, adoption is always a perfectly fine option. I believe abortions should be outlawed completely unless the baby is of significant danger to the mother. This excludes reasons for lack of money, responsibility, rape, etc. If you can't handle a child but made the mistake of getting pregnant, deal with the consequences of it or put it up for adoption. Yes it is your body but I believe that argument is invalid since we are dealing with another human being's life. Just imagine if Martin Luther King Jr.'s mother was like ""nah i don't really want a baby"", or George Washington's, or anyone historically important or even someone who just means a lot to you, like family. I can't even imagine all of the potentially great people we have let have been aborted...If you get pregnant, it is meant to be. There is no need to play God, just put it up for adoption if you can't take care of it yourself."	(32.520564531612656)
563	Fetuses are not full humans but that isn't even the point. Unless you are going the take care of the baby then no one should be able to control a woman's choice about it. No one is going to have an abortion just to feel joy in killing their egg. Like going through pregnancy abortion is also painful. Do you people really think a woman wants to kill her child? If a woman is raped and doesn't want to have to take care of a child by herself that she did not even want, she should not have to. If a 17 year old girl makes a mistake and ends up pregnant, who is anyone else to tell her that she has to stop her life and stop school to focus on a child. The child can be neglected because the mother still is trying to live her young life, or starving because she just can not afford it. Christians are not the only religion in the world and half of them aren't even abiding to their own law so who are they to force a law on someone else??	(32.3968434272274)
244	The baby is growing inside of the woman and without the woman the baby would die. Those of you who say that the baby has a right to its body etc. A woman has the right to control whats happening in her body.

440	Many people think that because I was adopted I should be pro-life because I could have been aborted, but I remain pro-choice because I would never have known about my life if I was. If it would have made my biological mother happier, then ultimately it would be fine with me because it's her body that was holding me and her life that would have been altered if she kept me. Although adoption is a choice, there are thousands of children out there without any parents, still waiting to get adopted, and some are very unhappy because of it. I'm aware of the consequences that can come with abortion, but keeping the baby/having the baby adopted isn't for everyone, just like abortion isn't either.	(35.393508886102076)

It might be her body, But there is also another life inside of her and its not her life to end. For example the minute her doctor announces to her that she is pregnant she doesn't stop and think ""I have 20 fingers"" because why that life is separate from her. So I ask again when does life begin? To the people that think life begins when we are born would that mean you would still abort an eight month old baby in the womb or seven. When would be the time where we decide life starts. For those of you who did not a baby can't start to grow until whats called conception which is when the egg and the sperm meet. Its obvious to me that, Without that a baby can not start to form and that is where life for everyone begins. Have you ever stop to think if being pro-choice even makes sense to you, Or do you just keep using the rape excuse until someone budges? Think what is the opposite of life, Is it not death? Sounds harsh, I know but that's what your covering death with that choice, And what is the final choice to take away the life of the baby. I personally if you can't already tell am pro-life, And I try to hear people out and   see it from another point of view. I thought to myself if I was raped and got pregnant should I abort. My final answer would be no. Why? I would choose not to not just because statistically its a very very low possibility of that happening but because I believe that if god wanted me to be pregnant then so be it. I would love my child because the child wouldn't have been the problem. For those who wouldn't want it, Does it really cost you to let your baby live and put up for adoption instead of paying what thousands for an abortion. Also, To the ones who might have their health be at risk for having a baby, I believe in miracles and they happen everyday no women, No doctor, No man can tell you the final answer only god because whether we like it or not he has the final say, And finally for the ones who would still choose to abort because they made one stupid mistake and don't want to be embarrassed its not the babys fault and you know that very well."

507	I love that almost every argument here for a pro-life advocate is that abortions are a genocide of the young.   However if you ask what should happen to the humans that fight for their religious beliefs across the globe they would say bomb 'em.   So if we are to use the preposition that if a human is doing harm to you be it emotionally (terrorism) or physically than we have the right to protect ourselves from that human.   By the argument given by the pro-lifers is then that an unborn child is a human does the mother not have the same rights to protect themselves from emotional or physical damage.   What they really want to say is the everyone should pay for their bad choices and suffer.   So if a teenager gets pregnant the only way to teach her not to do it again is to force her through a process her emotional development has not prepared her for.   Now to say all women at any age are ready to be responsible for another life seems tenuous at best and brings us back to choice.   Why is it so wrong for someone to not have the government tell them whether or not they can have an abortion.   If the only argument is because they are killing an innocent than Christians need to look at their own history, and how many wars have been fought, how many innocents have died to their ideals.   Pro-lifers have a valid opinion and as that they can believe it, but I can not disprove an opinion, only state facts, and humans die every day to the choices people make.   If you are not going to allow sex education in schools then leave those same children ignorant of any responsibilities of the consequences and let them choose.	(31.59895660063021)

What if a girl gets raped and impregnated, She should have every right to abort that baby. What if a prostitute gets pregnant, I would rather her abort that child then have to raise it in an unstable home environment, Rough financial situation, And where that child may be exposed to drugs, Alcohol, Or abuse.

356	In my opinion, Abortion should be illegal but, I also think that only on special occasions should the women have the choice to have an abortion. I think that if only the women was raped or if they have the baby it might cause damage to the mother, like maybe death, then the women should have the choice whether to have the baby or not. But other than those special occasions I think the women has to have the baby and no matter what. One of the main issues that women argue about abortion being illegal is what if they were raped. That's why, in those types of cases I think its only fair to let the women decide. Because if they were raped and they did not have the choice to abort it then it could ruin there lives. But if they have the baby willingly, and were not raped but made a mistake, I think that that women has to step up and take responsibility for it. Women should not be able to have sex willingly but not want a baby, and then find out they are pregnant and just abort it, because then they will just do it again. If abortion was illegal and only those certain circumstances that I talk about is when the women could have an abortion, then women all around the world would become more responsible and would be more conscious over the actions that they take. This is why I think abortion should be illegal.	(30.67541275159878)
318	I believe that life begins when pregnancy begins. The baby is not part of the mother's body. Use contraception or don't have sex. Emergency contraception can be given to rape and domestic violence victims. Adoption is an option. Abortion is murder unless there is a valid medical reason. Debate me.	(30.099695278895243)
42	"Yea a women can get raped but it is not at all the babies fault. Yea you can carry the biggest, worst memory in your life, but God made everyone for a purpose. That baby wasn't made just 'cause but for a reason. ""Everything happens for a reason.""   Either for you to learn the hard way or to make you a better person."	(29.435945706358773)
370	Comes your body comes big responsibility ladies. It's unconstitutional that a woman can aport parenthood and get its sweep under the table as if it never happen. Yes a man can walk out of a kid's life, but he will be accounted for and financially responsible for the child and looked at as a dead beat. Its un equal that a woman can get a free out of parent card but yet a father cannot	(27.30299453333539)
342	I believe that if you made a dumb mistake of going to a party, getting drunk and impregnating a woman, you should pay for it and face the consequences face on, rather than forget about it and not face punishment,   because if there isn't any punishment, that everyone would go have sex and then abort. I believe if you were smart enough to impregnate someone due to stupidity, you should be smart enough to raise the kid. But if it is rape, then it should be legal because you had no way of preventing it or controlling it so that's the only time it should be legal.	(25.851663909419422)
453	"Why do y'all have to go and force your religion on others? If some one wants to get an abortion you better bloody let them! What if this person was raped y'all want this victim to carry the memory of their rapist   for the rest of her life? While many do think that it is a sin to abort a baby because it is murder why must you force your religious ideas on people who are not Christian? There are many other religions in the world and by making abortion illegal you are being so ignorant to say that ya'll and your ideal are the only correct way of thinking.

29	Abortion is never a mere personal choice but a grave offense against God and His creation. The anti-abortion struggle has always been a religious battle and foremost in its ranks have been Catholics across the country. This is because Church teaching on abortion is clear and unequivocal: Abortion is murder. There are no exceptions allowed, no compromises possible. It wrong and people should really think or use protection if you plan on having sex.	(24.289838486732016)
447	If I choose not to bring a person into this world because I have neither the economic nor social foundation to raise that person in the best possible environment, I am not only protect that child from growing up poor and in a psychologically damaging environment. I'm saving society from having to pay for my mistake, I save society from and increase in uneducated, unemployed civilians.	(23.25854829216724)
592	Being a mother is just one option for women. Many hard battles have been fought to win political and economic equality for women. These gains will not be worth much if reproductive choice is denied. To be able to choose a safe, Legal abortion makes many other options possible. Otherwise an accident or a rape can end a woman's economic and personal freedom.	(21.982534517553706)
