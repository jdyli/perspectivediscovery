     Thirdly is the environment.   How does a change of location classify a human as a nonperson? Does moving to a new state make you not a person? So how does living in a womb make a baby not a person, and quite simply it doesn't.

If the claim were made that life was discovered on another planet, for example, there are well-defined criteria to which we could refer to conclusively determine whether the claim was accurate.   How do scientists distinguish between life and non-life?

 LIFE cover photo A scientific textbook called ""Basics of Biology"" gives five characteristics of living things; these five criteria are found in all modern elementary scientific textbooks:

1. Living things are highly organized.

2. All living things have an ability to acquire materials and energy.

3. All living things have an ability to respond to their environment.

4. All living things have an ability to reproduce.

5. All living things have an ability to adapt.

According to this elementary definition of life, life begins at fertilization, when a sperm unites with an oocyte.   From this moment, the being is highly organized, has the ability to acquire materials and energy, has the ability to respond to his or her environment, has the ability to adapt, and has the ability to reproduce (the cells divide, then divide again, etc., and barring pathology and pending reproductive maturity has the potential to reproduce other members of the species).   Non-living things do not do these things.   Even before the mother is aware that she is pregnant, a distinct, unique life has begun his or her existence inside her.

Furthermore, that life is unquestionably human.   A human being is a member of the species homo sapiens.   Human beings are products of conception, which is when a human male sperm unites with a human female oocyte (egg).   When humans procreate, they don't make non-humans like slugs, monkeys, cactus, bacteria, or any such thing.   Emperically verifiable proof is as close as your nearest abortion clinic: send a sample of an aborted fetus to a laboratory and have them test the DNA to see if its human or not.

But it never will be because according to America's rights, women have the choice to kill their babies. Even if someone agrees that the baby actually is a life-form in the womb (which is still a human life-form no matter what stage it is at), they may say that women who are raped or unplanned should be allowed to abort their babies. I say they shouldn't for two reasons. The first, because their babies are their own and even if they did not expect it, they still have an orphanage or anywhere else they can go to live the rest of their lives. And if it was unplanned, it's simply being selfish and cruel. The second is because most women who abort their babies because of rape is a small percentage compared to those who abort because they did not plan for it. If a teenager gets pregnant and doesn't want her parents to know, that person is being selfish for the wrong that she did. It's wrong for her to end her baby's life before it starts because of her secrecy. It shouldn't be, but it nonetheless will continues long as adoption is an option, abortion is selfish. People should be able to choose whether or not they want to have children for themselves. If a women does not feel like she has the ability to carry the baby for 9 months or give birth or take care of the baby after then it should be okay. And as for giving the baby up to adopt, that's fine and dandy but as soon as a women becomes a mother by having the kid an immediate connection is formed. And baby has heard moms heartbeat for 9 months and mother has felt baby tumbling in her stomach. A bond is created even before birth and the ability to have an abortion can stop a bond from forming which can stop heartbreak later on. I just feel that Another life should not be wasted because someone did not choose to use protection know many will argue about rape, but those make up 1-2% of abortions. But, I'm not going to push my opinion on someone if they get it. But I won't support them. That's just my opinion.",Should not be legal,against,"[16, 24]"
49,49,1582733949-463,https://www.debate.org/opinions/is-abortion-moral,"Killing children is never moral. Simply the way they kill them is inexcusably inhumane.  There are four ways that unborn babies are killed. Look at this quote from an information site

(1) The suction method.

During an early pregnancy, the doctor can insert a tube through the opening of the mother’s womb, and connect it to a suction apparatus. The vacuum on the apparatus is so powerful that the fetus is instantly broken up into a mass of blood and tissue, and quickly passes through the tube, and is collected in a bottle.

(2) The forceps method.

Sometimes the doctor dilates the mouth of the womb, and inserts a spoon-like instrument with sharp edges (called a forceps). He reaches in with this tool and scrapes out the baby (and also the placenta). Sometimes he has to cut the baby into several pieces in order to get it out. The larger parts are cut into smaller pieces and spooned out piece by piece, and then discarded.

(3) The Caesarean-type method.

Larger babies may require an abdominal operation. The womb is cut open and the baby is lifted out. It usually squirms and moves its arms and legs; it tries to breathe; the heart often continues to beat; but the organs are not sufficiently developed, and so within a few hours, it usually dies.

(4) The chemical method.

The doctor sticks a large needle through the wall of the mother’s abdomen and into the womb. A strong, salt-water solution is injected. The baby thrashes around for a few moments, and then soon dies. Within twenty-four hours, labor starts, and the dead body is delivered.

Abortion is nothing but barbarianism in the Twentieth Century! No wonder some nurses are rebelling. They are expected to finish the work of abortion, by taking the crushed, bloody mass of the fetus, and then disposing of it.

People do not want the responsibility of a child because they could not wait until marriage, Graduation, And a solid job. Or they just engage in promiscuous sexual debauchery believing that there will be no consequence for their not responsible actions. 

So what does that breed. A delinquent generation. Abortion affirms freedom of responsibility that manifests itself in fatherless and motherless homes. It also shows up in the form of welfare leeches. It manifests itself in the form of whiny and weeping children that just happen to be 30 years old. 

So what about ""My body"" or ""you're a male you don't understand"". Well first of all, That demeans the child even further by saying my body my choice.

Second, I've heard abortion used as a issue for feminists. If a woman has a right to abort a baby that she consensually conceived with a man (rape is another issue), then what more right does she have to abort it than the man? If we're really going for equality, men should have just as much choice about the abortion as women. Thirdly, aborting children shows a decline in the respect for human life.

Look, if you don't want to have a baby, don't get pregnant. There are numerous ways to avoid it such as the pill, condoms or just not having sex.
I know, mistakes happen, right? Yes but that does not mean that your not responsible. Abortion tends to be just a way to be unaccountable for your actions, but what they don't understand is that they are actually punishing their unborn child instead.

Yes, I understand that here are situations where an abortion should be allowed like in the case of rape, incest, or if the mothers life is in serious danger. For instance; a woman I knew a long time back was diabetic (insulin dependent) and got pregnant. She had the choice of going off her insulin and risking her life or continuing her insulin and risking the life of her unborn baby. Tho I would have supported her had she chosen to use her insulin, she chose to go off it and died in childbirth.
Tho I am not in favor of it, I could see allowing the very young to have them because they may not be able to mentally cope with being pregnant, but this would be a one time deal because afterwards they should know the risk their actions caused.

Besides the lack of accountability I have with the claim of ""accidents happen"" is the alarming number of women who have multiple abortions. From what I have read, about 44% of women who have an abortion, have more than one. (1) I even read another article about a woman who had 15 of them in a 17 year period. (2) Sad how, when most women go for their annual check-up, she went for her annual abortion. You must admit, that is just wrong.

Abortion
I know that abortion as a constitutional right proves false due to one of the commandment. The fifth commandment says you shall not murder and abortion equals to murder. Some will say, ‘It's not alive until birth.’ That is certainly not true! A human is a human when it is made not at birth. Why would any living soul want to kill a helpless little human that cannot defend itself from the harm coming its way. It's not even old enough to understand pain, yet it goes through so much pain that it kills them. To that I just say… what the heck! It's like walking up to your 5 year old and killing it because you don't want them anymore so just slice slice done don't have to deal with you anymore! That's just, mind my saying,   stupid - insanely stupid! It’s unremarkably stupid and sad that that child, that miniature human being will never see the light of day, their mothers face, they would never grow up, have kids of their own, or have a real family and life. When you abort a baby you take a helpless life that just sits there...Wondering, ‘What's going on? Why are they doing this? Why are my parents letting them?’ You kill your child. You take away happiness and sadness and all other feelings and experiences. You are a murderer. And you should carry that guilt and shame to the grave saying, ‘Why did I do that to that innocent human being?’ Even if you're not ready or can't give them what they need, there is always a second option. Give them a fighting chance at a good life at a good adoption home. There is always another option and never any reason to resort to death, because people are people no matter how big, how small, white or black, tall or thin, baby or elder… a person is a person and they have feelings whether you admit to it or not.",ITS A NO FRIKIN BRAINIER!

Pro-choice advocates always bring up the anecdotal, sad situation of a woman who was raped, will die if she has the baby, was just diagnosed with cancer, and has no money to afford the child.   The fact is that the vast, vast majority of abortions (somewhere around 99%) are due from sheer irresponsibility.   Such as skipping out on birth-control, being to lazy or inconvenienced to use a condom, drunk sex, having a change of heart, etc.   Yes, condoms break, yes birth control isn't 100% effective, but the failure rates are certainly not on par with the number of abortions performed.   Pro-choice should be willing to quit arguing on behalf of the anecdotal cases of rape, incest, and harm to the mother's life and instead discuss the 99% of abortions which stem from the belief that your right to convenience is more significant than a fetus's right to live.   Men who irresponsibly impregnate a female should also own-up to their mistakes, and support the child and his/her mother.   Conception is very simple, anytime one ejaculates inside of a females vagina, the potential for conception occurs.   If you feel that engaging in protected or unprotected sex is worth the potential risk of impregnation, then go ahead and have intercourse, but don't be surprised when life is conceived (and especially don't be surprised if you did not use protection and life is conceived).   If your not comfortable with the risk presented from sex, then abstain from vaginal intercourse.   Sorry, biology can be a pain the a$$.   Overall 99% of abortions can be prevented.

First off, every person who has some common sense knows that when you have sex a consequence may be pregnancy, and legalising abortion basically is making it ok for anyone to do what ever they want without being responsible for their actions and dealing with the consequences.
Obviously there are circumstances of rape and in that case have the baby and then give it up for adoption as many couples would love and appreciate the child more than you would.

1) All human beings have the right to life.
2) Fetuses are human beings
C) Fetuses have the right to life.

Let me anticipate 3 objections:
1. “Fetuses are not conscious and therefore, have no right to life.”
Answer: Unconscious born human beings have the right to life so therefore, unborn human beings must also have the right to life. We don't give up our right to life when we are in a coma or are asleep.

2. “Fetuses can’t feel pain and therefore have no right to life.”
Answer: The right to life is not contingent upon the capacity to feel pain. People who have congenital analgesia have the right to life. Congenital analgesia is a condition where one cannot feel pain.

3. “Fetuses have no past experiences and therefore have no right to life.”
Answer: Probably the best objection of the three but it ultimately fails by looking at someone who has had their memory wiped by Alzheimer’s disease and is currently in a coma. We would say that they have the right to life. Despite the fact that they don’t have past experiences, it is immoral to rip their limbs off.

We need to figure out if the baby is a part of the mother's body. Obviously it is not since the baby is 100% genetically unique (unless there are twins). It is objectively not part of the mother's body. It is also objectively human since it contains human DNA. It is made up of living tissue, so the baby is a living human being, distinct from the mother. Therefore, the argument falls apart in two ways, but shall wee add a third? 

Even if we were to say being inside of the mother is equal to being a part of the mother, the argument would still be less than convincing. Using this principle, the baby only becomes a person when it passes through the magical vagina at birth and gains the right not to be brutally murdered. This is the point when the baby is not inside the mother any more. Are we really to believe that a baby is a living human person 1 minute after birth, but could be killed 1 minute before birth?

Do you think they can live without the mother constantly feeding them and caring for them? If you left a baby alone in a house, what do you think would happen? It's completely dependent on its caretaker. Babies are just further along in the development cycle. There isn't a massive break between an unborn baby and a born baby, it just learned how to live outside.

Now take a three year old kid. If you left them alone in the house, they would be fine. If you took them out and left them in the woods, they would probably die. Does that make them more human than a baby, since they can live alone for longer? No, they're just further along the development cycle. 

My point is that there are just degrees of dependency. Arbitrarily drawing the line of ""no longer inside the mother's body"" is still arbitrary.

Abortion is basically committing MURDER. According to our law, murdering is not allowed. Killing a baby who is innocent and has committed no crime is worse than death penalty; killing a criminal who has committed crime. It takes away the baby’s right to live, and according to the Declaration of Independence, it says, “We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” Every human on earth is precious and created specifically for a purpose on earth.

Abortion, besides it being one of the worse crime, is bad for the woman. According to health specialists, abortion may weaken a woman’s reproductive system, and increases more chances of getting breast, uterine, or cervical cancer by 50%. Several physical complications when doing abortion includes, “cervical lacerations and injury, uterine perforations, bleeding, hemorrhage, serious infection, pain, and incomplete abortion.” Some other emotional complications include, “major depression, anxiety disorder, suicidal behaviors, and substance dependence.” Besides all these complications, the fact that the woman feels guilt killing her unborn baby is already enough to dread her the rest of her life.

Thirteen out of fifteen studies conducted on American women report increased risk. Seventeen studies are statistically significant, sixteen of which found increased risk.

also the study found that the fetus feels pain worse than adults. “Mechanisms that inhibit or moderate the experience of pain do not begin to develop until 32 to 34 weeks post-fertilization. Any pain the unborn child experiences before these pain inhibitors are in place is likely more intense than the pain an older infant or adult experiences when subjected to similar types of injury.”

Imagine not having any say in whether or not you want to have a life. Well babies don't have a choice in their mother’s womb. If a woman decides to abort her baby, the innocent little babies can't do anything about their life being taken away from them. Their whole future is demolished. Abortion is wrong when committing it for a selfish reason or any reason for that matter. Women may say that it’s their body and they can do what they want to, but in reality it's not just their body. They are caring for an innocent little soul. Also the physical and mental risks to the mother are outstandingly high. In school we have been taught that everyone's life is equal, yet when women get an abortion they are saying that the little innocent baby is less important than the mother or less valuable than anybody else's life. If murder is considered a felony, then why should killing an innocent little human being be okay?
I think that we can all agree that as Americans we live by the philosophy that killing is wrong but somehow we seem to think that abortion is okay? The definition of killing is to cause death and the simple fact is that having an abortion is killing someone. Whether or not you think abortion should be allowed; it cannot be disputed that a doctor is harming a living organism when performing an abortion. By allowing abortions we could be killing anyone that might have advanced genes or special abilities that could later help us. One study reported, “In a national study of women, 64% of those who aborted felt pressured to do so by others. This pressure can become violent. 65% suffered symptoms of trauma. In the year following an abortion, suicide rates are 6-7 times higher,” (How Many Women Are Pressured Into Abortions). In conclusion when you are getting an abortion, you are taking a life and killing a human being. The baby is alive and not just some 'group of cells' abortion doctors call them. You are painfully putting a child to death. It is wrong to think someone has the power to end a life so harmfully.

That's a matter of perspective but if you ask me I'd say no.

That's an entirely different debate (I think evolution is ridiculous, but it's a moot point for this argument), but people always assume ""God"" would respect life. Would He? Is abortion against God? What if we live in some sort of simulation, and the programmer doesn't really care if we kill each other? I mean consider that for a moment. Everything in this life includes the presence of killing. Plants and animals are always being killed, for each other and for us. There are so many horror stories about the meat industry.

You don't have to respect life if you don't want to, but you shouldn't be ignorant of when the life begins. It begins when the new organism is conceived.

394,394,1582734700-1020,https://www.debate.org/opinions/should-abortion-be-illegal,"Abortion should be legal for numerous reasons:
1. A fetus is not part of the female body
Scientific evidence has proven that the fetus has its own circulatory system, immune system, different DNA and blood type from the mother. Additionally, Scientists say that the fetus should not be considered part of a woman's body, because it does not originate from the woman. It is a mixture of female and male chromosomes.
2. It is murder
Since the fetus is a different person from the mother, it is also a different life. Therefore, to abort it before it is able to survive on its own, is killing it. This is known as murder.
3. If abortion is made illegal, women will risk their lives.
It is true that if abortion were made illegal, women will risk their lives at back alley abortion clinics. While this is a good point, it is also a ridiculous one. Pro-life people do not use abortions. Therefore, the only people who would or could use abortions are pro-choice. Therefore, if abortions were made illegal, the only people who would perform and thus take the lives of women at back alley abortion clinics, would be pro-choice. And since there jobs are to protect and save women, if they are found taking their lives, they would ultimately lose their popularity and crowd who voted for them. Who is this bad for? The pro-choice. Because it will not take a lot of women dying at back alley abortion clinics, due to pro-choice actions (i.E. Continuing abortion when it is illegal in unsafe conditions) to realize that abortion in that case is stupid and not worth it. Furthermore, what is so important that a woman would risk her own life at a back alley abortion clinic? What sense does it make doing this because she wants to do something she cares about? The woman will realize that she can't do anything, if she's dead.
4. Circumstances for abortion
The pro-choice do make a valid point when they say that there should be abortion for some circumstances, such as rape, severe deformity of the child and the pregnancy threatening the mother's health/ life. However, instances of pre-marital sex, teenage pregnancy and not wanting a child, are not legitimate circumstances because the people involved should not be having sex in he first place. Therefore, it would be up to parental advice and common sense, to prevent those circumstances from happening. However, a few instances are no reason to have abortion openly legal.

There are many ways that scientists and medical professionals have suggested we decide when the unborn child is technically alive and near every single one is before the point where abortion becomes illegal. Twenty-four weeks. When the egg is fertilised that ball of cells is growing, taking in nutrients and expelling waste so it can officially be classed as a living organism.   After between five and ten weeks the embryo has a functioning brain and beating heart. Do I even need to go on? And please don’t think it is ok as the embryo might feel no pain, that theory would make it ok to anesthetise a toddler or an elderly person and then kill them. Murder is murder. 
	It is the mother’s right you say, how can she possibly be expected to live with a child she does not want?   Well for those who are so pro-choice, what about the choice of that unborn child? In the UK we do not allow capital punishment or euthanasia because we respect the fact that nothing is justifiable for murder and no one human being can surely have the power to lawfully end the life of another. A judge cannot sentence someone to be killed. A doctor may not help in a case of assisted suicide. But a mother may murder her own helpless, baby. If the child cannot make the decision then no one else should be able to make the choice for it, you could say that it might have a life threatening problem, or it won’t have a sufficient home for a happy childhood. A disadvantaged life is, and always will be, better than no life. 
That mother may have lost her reputation, her morals and some non-refundable time but that baby lost more, so much more. That baby lost its life and with it, its chance at having its own family and loved ones, the ability to be human and experience the world, make a differences and its potential to think, feel, love and admire. How can anyone, lets alone its own mother be allowed to take all that away from it. It is tragic and saddening if a woman is sexually abused and becomes pregnant with an unwanted child but under no circumstances should that baby take the blame for something that it did not cause.

Note what Josephus, in his histories of the Jews, states concerning abortion, ""The law orders all the offspring to be brought up, and forbids woman either to cause abortion or to make away with the fetus, a woman convicted of this is regarded as an infanticide because she destroys a soul and diminishes the race."" 

The United States is a country where 5,500 abortion clinics abort 30% of all pregnancies. In our nation's capital there are three abortions performed for every one live birth, and this is not uncommon. Since 1980 abortions have outnumbered live births in 18 metropolitan areas of the United States. The shame of this problem is reflected in the statistic that 99% of all abortions are performed on demand. This means that the only prerequisite that is demanded of the mother is her desire to rid herself of the developing fetus. For years we have heard the cry that if abortions were abolished, ""What would happen to the woman who finds herself in the position of having been raped, involved in incest, has a severe fetal deformity, or her life is at stake?"" The way this argument is presented leads one to believe that abortions are here because of such cases. However, let us not blind you with the facts! Only 1% of the abortions performed annually in this country are for rape, incest, fetal deformity, or the mother's health. Many believe that the percentage is even smaller than this. Let us note a fact concerning pregnancy in the case of rape or incest. ""The case of rape and incest is really a non-issue because of its rare occurrence. It is estimated that in 5,000 to 10,000 rapes, only one pregnancy will result. In a typical US city with a population of 500,000 that would be one case every 10 to 20 years!""

 There are at least five major procedures that are used to terminate an unwanted pregnancy. (1) The vacuum suction method. ""The vacuum is so powerful that the baby is instantly broken up into a fluid mass of blood, tissue, and cartilage."" (2) The cutting up method. ""The doctor just slices the baby into pieces inside the womb of the mother. The skull is crushed with the concepts to reduce its size for the withdrawal."" (3) The surgical method. ""The abdomen of the mother is surgically opened and the baby removed. The baby is then either used in experiments or else burned or drowned in water."" (4) The Saline Method. ""A salt solution is injected into her amniotic sac where the baby is literally burned to death -in effect pickling the baby.

But not all people believe what God says, so let's look at it from a different angle. We are allowed to take life under the prescribed requirements of law, such as self defense, war, execution, etc.   Each of these areas deals with Law.   Self defense is justified because an antagonist is breaking the law (burglary, robbery, assault, etc.), and we can use force to protect ourselves and our property.   War is the legal declaration of hostilities towards another nation.   Execution is the legal taking of life against someone who has committed a crime, or crimes, worthy of execution.   In each case, the antagonists are dealt with for the wrongs they have committed. However, the baby in the womb has done no wrong, yet it is executed.   It is executed but has broken no law!   What crime has been committed?   What law have they broken in their existence?   None.   Yet they are killed. I am reminded of Nazi Germany.   The Jews were guilty of being Jews, and were, according to the Nazis, worthy of death.   Likewise, the babies in the womb are guilty of being babies in the womb, and are, according to the parents, worthy of death.   What laws did they break?   What made them unworthy of life? The answer is simple: it depends on the opinion of those in power, of those wielding the knife and redefining what is life, and of those deciding who is worthy of life and who should die. It is only in abortion that someone is executed but has not violated the law.   This is fundamentally wrong, and this is why abortion is wrong. Since when do we kill someone who's broken no law?

515,515,1582734815-1467,https://www.debate.org/opinions/is-abortion-wrong,"The biggest question is when the mass of cells in the womb becomes a human.   It's generally deemed wrong to kill an adult, teenager, child, or baby because they are humans.   The same should hold true for any human, be it still in the womb or not.   

But when does the fetus become human?   Well, there are really only two obvious, significant landmarks in the development of a human that could designate humanity:   conception and birth.   In between, lots of little things happen, but not one of them are significant enough to point at and say ""Now THAT's what makes it a human.""   

Even the idea that brain activity makes someone a human is flawed, because the start of brain activity is not a sudden thing; it happens gradually and there is no real way to tell exactly when the fetus starts “thinking.”   

So if the human is made at birth, then even a fully developed fetus could be killed under the guise of not being a human, so long as it hasn't been born.   This seems to me as not right.   There is not really any significant development during birth itself, as evidenced by babies born premature.   

So all that leaves is conception.   The moment two humans come together to make another human is an appropriate place to name as the start of life.   By this logic, killing anything beyond conception would be considered killing a human.   

So is it wrong?   Well, this is where definitions get confused, namely the subtle difference between kill and murder.   Killing is the taking of a life.   Murder is the taking of life with malicious or careless intent.   I would contend that it is justifiable to kill a person in a number of situations (e.G., protection from loss of life, protection from injury, etc.), but never justifiable to murder.   So if a woman were to be in danger of death because of the baby, an abortion would be a justifiable killing.   If the woman were to, say, just not be in the mood for a baby, it would be murder and, therefore, wrong.   

So the choice for women is this:   is it a justifiable death, and if it it is, will you take advantage of it?",When is it a human?,against,[16]

Let's just get out of the way first that a fetus has been scientifically proven to be a living thing from the moment it is conceived. So when a mother- and I say mother because though the child may not be born, it is a child- goes into a clinic and has an abortion, she is killing a living thing. Say she also has a one year-old child as well. As far as 'life' is concerned, killing the one year-old child is on par with killing the unborn child. Because, as with the fetus, the one year-old is still a potential life, something that is still developing and is yet to make an impact on the wider world. Most people would look at that, the idea of killing a young child, and be revolted. They would go up in arms against the mother for murder, and she would go to prison. That is because it is unanimously decided that killing a living child is horrific and disgusting. For some unimaginably bizarre reason, people defend the legality of a 'hidden murder', where a mother kills a helpless child that is inside her. The reasons for doing so are many, and I understand that things such as rape and even inconvenience can be extremely difficult to deal with, but there are other ways around it, and mothers should not be so quick to give up their status as a mother and murder a child.

Murder is the “unlawful killing of a human being” with some level of intent. California law includes “a deliberate intention unlawfully to take away the life of a fellow creature.”

stop abortion The only thing preventing abortion from being included in the definition of murder is that it’s currently not “unlawful.” But basic science proves that an unborn child is a “human being.” No mention of “personhood” is necessary for basic murder definitions. Killing a “human being” or a “fellow creature,” even, is enough.

Why, as a society, do we pick and choose human beings whom we can deliberately kill? These human beings are fully human, entirely innocent, and helpless and voiceless. Yet we purposely target them, setting very few restrictions on their killings.

Is there any other class of human beings that our society will make it “lawful” to kill? Belgium is already on the path to extending legal murder through its legalization of euthanasia – even child euthanasia. History shows that Nazi Germany, once it began to legalize the murder of human beings, simply continued down the path – the elderly, the sick, the disabled, gypsies, homosexuals, the Jews, those who defended the Jews. Where would it have stopped?

This is why abortion must be illegal if murder is illegal. It should never be “lawful” to kill any innocent human being.

You may argue the emotional damage to rape victims if they keep the child.
You may argue over population.
You are not an aborted fetus now, are you?

Whether the zygote/fetus/baby has any appearance or characteristic of being human is inconsequential in that fact that humanity is formed, and cannot be formed in any other means, save for when a sperm and egg fuse, to form something that is the basis of all human life. All the elements of human bodies (a heart, a brain, the ability to smile) are inside that zygote. A person is conceived into existence at that very moment in time and space. That multiple celled organism is the first form of your mom, your brother, your best friend, your baby you hold in your arms, and you.

When you are raped, this is emotionally scarring. But if all human life begins as the zygote, then the largest test of your morality and selflessness, no matter the fact that you do not deserve any more thoughts of your abuse, would be to put yourself aside, and give this person that is vulnerably living within you a chance. The ultimate test of your selflessness afterwards, is to push from you something so terrible, and find the will to sacrifice nine months of your life to possible give another human 70+ years or so of theirs. Would your family die for you? Would the person you love die for you? Would you die for someone you love? Well carrying a baby is not death women. Life goes on for you, and many years into the future, you can look back and decide whether you thought it right to give someone a family and a future of their own. I know any person with a heart would be happy thinking about that.

 Rape is sick, it's damaging, but does it make it morally right to then kill someone else? And don't try to think of abortion as taking a problem of your hands, because then that innocent human in you is not the problem. Adoption is always a selfless option.

Not including rape victims, overpopulation is caused by humans own conscience being. They choose to sleep with a man. They choose to allow that window of conception be present, whether     by intentional means or accident. Whether you used a little or a lot of protection, you are partaking in an act, no matter how casual it may be, that we were given to procreate. So even if you get pregnant after you take that pill, no means of protection are 100% preventable. Unless you get your tubes tied or ovaries taken out. Should you then take the chance of life away from them? No matter how many times someone complains that having that baby is adding to overpopulation, that is not the child's fault.

It is easy to say that something is okay if they are ignorant of what is really happening.   Abortion is legal in many states up to 24 weeks which means that glob of cells, as so many on here have called it,   has a fully formed face with eybrows and eyelashes.   The process to abort this ""glob of cells"" , because it is too big to just be vaccumed out, starts with forceps that have to crush the skull, spine, and pelvis in order to get it out.   It also doesn't come out in one piece. 
If the ""glob of cells"" is prematurely born at 24 weeks, with modern day medicine, it has a 75-80% chance of living.   So if the ""glob of cells"" is born at 24 weeks, is it still a glob of cells until the end of that week?   Technically the mom should still be able to decide if the Dr should crush the ""glob of cells""   with his forceps until the end of the 24th week.

The statement, ""Pro choice is prow omen"" is false in . I would like to direct this next point to all people who are debating which side they want to take, pro life or pro choice. If you have children, think to yourself, would you want someone to try to justify killing them? For those who don't have children, look at all the people in your life, if their mother decided to have an abortion would you be the same person without that particular person?

What about her friends, and school, oh no life is ruined. Oh wait but she can get an Abortion and kill the child before it even touches earth’s air. That’s why I think Abortion should be illegal in the United States. NO women should be able to have an Abortion. There are many reasons for why this illegalization should take place all over the United States. 
 Did you know Abortion is considered murder? Well yes, it is a type of murder. Abortion is considered murder because, it is the life of a child in the process of being made, being killed. People might say that the baby is not alive yet but that’s false because, life is created when the sperm hits the egg. Most of the time when Abortions do take place the child’s heart has already started forming so it is already a human being when killed.
 Abortion can cause mental problems for Women. Abortion can affect the woman getting the abortion. It can cause emotional pain or distress for her. Such things like Depression and/or Anxiety. You may even have suicidal thoughts and that might lead to you committing suicide. 
 Another reason Abortion should be illegal is because, fetuses can feel pain. It has been noted/ studied that fetuses can begin to feel pain at 3 weeks of growing inside the mother. The fetus can feel the pain as it is dying. On some monitors, you may be able to see the fetus screaming as if in pain while the Abortion is taking place.
 Though I feel as though Abortions should be illegal, some people feel as though they shouldn’t be illegal but that any one should be able to have an Abortion on their unborn child. People feel as Women should have control over their own bodies. Also it is said that women who are denied abortions are more likely to become unemployed and be on public welfare and be below the poverty line.

Abortion is NOT a woman's right. Abortion is murder. 

1. Margaret Sanger was racist, and the reason she started planned parenthood was to get rid of the uneducated, blacks, the poor and many more she deemed unfit to live in her perfect world. She was one of Hitler's inspirations.

2. Out of all the abortions Planned Parenthood performs, only 2% of them are from rape. Why would a woman punish her child for a crime committed by its father? Not even rapists get the death penalty because it is deemed a cruel and unusual punishment. People are thrown in jail for messing with an eagle egg, but women are ENCOURAGED to murder their children for their own convenience because it is their ""right"". Life begins at conception, and is to be protected until natural death.

3. It is NOT a woman's body, so it is NOT her choice. Is she the one dying? No. She is not. One type of abortion involves the abortionist tearing apart the baby, and taking it out in pieces. They have to make sure that each and every piece is taken out because, since it has different DNA, it can cause an infection. DIFFERENT. DNA. IT IS NOT THE WOMAN'S BODY, THERE IS ANOTHER BODY INVOLVED. THEY HAVE TO REMOVE IT BECAUSE IT HAS A DIFFERENT GENETIC MAKE UP THAN ITS MOTHER.

4. The media has completely made sex about the pleasure, when it was originally made simply for procreation. It's stupid when a woman has sex, and then has the nerve to act surprised that she has become pregnant. WHAT THE HECK DID YOU THINK WAS GONNA HAPPEN?? Contraceptives are not 100% effective, and people rely so heavily on them in order to run away from their responsibilities. That is the same as people who are abandoning their children in garbage cans and in subway stations. They don't want to have that responsibility. Don't want kids? Don't have sex.

I agree that it's better for things like this to be planned, but if a woman becomes pregnant before she is ready, it is selfish to just rid that child of its life.

As for the ever-appearing 'what if they were raped' clause, if they were raped, they can always receive help. The only obligation a person who was raped has is to ask for help. If they're ashamed of carrying a baby in them that was made through rape, then they should see a counselor. A woman should feel no shame from rape and should feel no shame in carrying a child.

Life has long since been known to start at conception and a fetus inside a human womb can only be human itself. 

Is it ok if a pregnant woman smokes, Drinks, Or does drugs? If she does so; it will harm her baby. If the woman decides she no longer wants the child, Does it make it ok for her to do these things? 
 
How a woman feels about the child inside her body does not change whether the fetus is alive or not. It does not change whether the fetus is a human with rights or not. Intentions and feelings are not the defining factors of truth or reality. 

A woman has the choice to have sex or to not have sex. If she gets pregnant as a result of her choice, That is the natural consequences of her actions. She now has a responsibility to care for the child who has been conceived. 

This is one of the many reasons why rape is such a terrible crime. The rapist has taken the choice away from a woman and forced the responsibility of a child onto her. 

Telling a woman she cannot murder her child is not oppressing her. The rapist is the one who committed the injustice and forced her to bear an unwanted responsibility. Punish the rapist severely but do not punish the child for the crime of its parent. 

The child is innocent and has a right to life even to the detriment of the mother. That is what it means to be a parent, Your children's needs come before your own (wanted or unwanted). 

If the fetus is not a living human child then there is nothing wrong with abortion. It would be the same as removing a skin growth or a tumor. The fetus is not just a lump of tissue, Nor is it a parasite, Nor is it an invader. It is an innocent living child. 

 Some people say they do not agree with abortion personally, But they don't want to take away another person's choice to have one. That logic is inconsistent. These people are failing to understand the simple fact that the fetus is a human child. 

 It is like saying I don't personally agree with slavery but I don't want to take away a person's right to own a slave. These people are unintentionally supporting the legal ""right"" to dismember a child alive in the womb. 

For any argument in support abortion or slavery, You must first deny the humanity of the ""slave"" and the ""fetus. "" Only this presupposition: that these subjects are not ""human persons"", Allows for any future debate on these issues.

1. No one should have a choice to murder another person. Rape and life of the mother are rare circumstances and all the pro-life legislation that's been getting put out has exceptions for them, furthermore a number of states had laws allowing abortion in such cases before Roe v. Wade,abortion was legalized for other reasons. That these issues are brought up shows pro-choice people know inside that abortion is inexcusable ""on demand"" save for specific circumstances. 

2. Privacy is no excuse for killing someone in your home or your body. Right to one's body doesn't include the right to harm others with that body whether punching them with your fist, yelling fire in a theatre to cause a stampede that results in deaths, or slandering someone. Your right to throw a punch stops where another's nose begins. 

3. This is ultimately about when a human life begins and when it comes to that brain cells appear after 2 weeks, the heart beats at 3 weeks, brain waves begin at 6 weeks, pain perception and fingerprints at 8 weeks, body sensitive to touch at 10 weeks, breathing of amniotic fluid and all facial expressions evident at 11 weeks, crying at 12 weeks, all senses present at 13 weeks. 

4. The majority of Americans can recognize abortion after 12 weeks is wrong, yet abortion is allowed in all 9 months of pregnancy, and generally legal until 24 weeks, even though the earliest recorded pregnancy is at 21 weeks. Why is it alright to kill a child at the same stage as one outside the womb? Obviously this is murder. Only 24% of Americans say abortion should be legal after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy according to Gallup. 

5. Abortion is the greatest wrong committed against women in the world today, driving a mass destruction of female life in the Asian region and the sex trafficking that occurs there. Sex-selective abortion in China has resulted in 32 million missing women, and is resulting in sex trafficking from nearby countries like Thailand. It's even worse when surveyed in the scope of all Asia, as other countries like India have millions more missing women from abortion eugenics. 

Clearly abortion is murder after 12 weeks of pregnancy and 76% of Americans recognize this. The Guttmacher Institute states 1.21 million abortions occur in the U.S. Each year and 11% after 12 weeks of pregnancy. Therefore, about 133,000 abortions each year are murder and recognized as such by 76% of Americans.","No right to kill, in privacy of home or body",against,"[16, 22]"

How does that make sense. The argument of viability is completely bogus. So many people believe life doesn't start until the baby is viable, but this is based on a dangerous premise -- that viability=life. That's incorrect. If I tossed the strongest, healthiest man on earth onto the moon, he'd lose his viability. Does that make him a dead man? He's not viable! But of course not, we still think he's a life, and a healthy one at that. Just cause the baby is in a different environment doesn't make him any less viable than the man on the moon. Somehow, though, we believe that the not viable man on the moon is a life, while the inviable baby is just a small fetus. Also, the baby may be ""viable"" after it's born, but if the mother abandons it, just like she'd abandon the aborted baby, the viable baby would die too. Clearly, viability is not an issue.



With that being said, many still struggle with the idea that life begins at conception. However, while I can understand the logic, the logic is still fallacious. Think about a small seedling. Is it any less a life than the trees in California's great Redwood Forest? No. Why? Because it has great potential, if cared for correctly, to become a strong tree. In the same way, once the baby is conceived, s/he has the same potential, if cared for correctly, to become a strong wo/man. There's no more evident moment in one's life when s/he becomes alive, than the moment of conception. One can point to that as ""the time I was conceived and was given life,"" but no other time in one's life can be pointed to in the same way. By the 22nd day, the baby has it's own heart and blood type. But that's not one moment's happening, it's a gradual development. The ONE MOMENT is conception. And that is life.



Going off of the heart discussion. We say one is dead when his/her heart stops beating. So why don't we say one is alive when his/her heart starts pumping? If you can't accept the conception argument (which I believe is clear), then you can easily understand this argument. Well then, I'm sorry, the baby is ALIVE, before most women even know it's there. No matter how you look at it, the baby is alive. 



Now for the most stubborn argument -- human rights. Those who argue for the mother's right to decide the fate of the child and think they're legally sound are vaguely misinformed. Family law has laws that protect children from parents. It is illegal for a parent to see his/her child in danger and not act to save the child. Obviously, it is even a more disturbing situation when the parent actively harms the child. It then follows that killing a child is worse than just beating/abusing the child, and if it is illegal to abuse your own child, it is illegal to kill your own child. It is even illegal to put your child in an unreasonably dangerous situation.  Having proven that the baby is a life at conception (or if you're leaning towards heartbeat, either way), then the baby has just as much right as any child, born or unborn. Any reasonable mother takes care of their children after they're  born, and it isn't right for the mother to abandon the child. It then logically follows that it isn't right for the mother to abandon an unborn child. ”But what about the mother's rights?“ one may ask.  What mother's rights? Are you trying to tell me that the mother is being forcibly invaded by the baby? Sit back, and think about this. First of all, the volitional act of sleeping with whoever the mother slept with was the mother's act. She may not have intended for the baby to happen, but she definitely knew it was a possibility. She has no right, whatsoever, to destroy a life that she conceived. She is legally responsible for the child, no matter what. ""But what about the raped mothers?"" one asks, demanding for justice. After the baby is born, the mother (and father, technically) is reasonably and obviously responsible for the baby, bar giving the baby up for adoption or other such understandable acts. So then, why is the mother not responsible for the baby after s/he is born? This makes no sense. The baby is alive in both cases, and the mother understands, that, for the baby to develop healthily, the baby needs to be in the mother's womb. That's natural. I don't condone the rape, at all, but it's not for the baby to take up the responsibility of making up for anything. It wasn't his/her choice to come into the world. Maybe the mother/father did not want it either, but they were responsible for bringing him/her in the world, so they must keep that responsibility. 



Also, for the mothers' own sake, aborting a child is bad choice anyway. The mothers, statistically, have a much greater chance becoming depressed or subject to other mental illnesses after abortion. This is no coincidence. They are, after all, ultimately responsible for killing their own baby. While in their minds they might tell themselves, ""it was just a fetus,"" they know deep down that it's not true.",When?,against,"[16, 20, 24]"

Just who do we think we are to attempt to wrangle life itself!?   All for what?   An easier go at life for ourselves?   We owe these children much much more than that.

 Women deserve the rights to their bodies, absolutely.   But they do have some culpability here as well.   They have a moral obligation to either use their bodies responsibly or take responsibility when a pregnancy occurs.   Don't get me wrong, that goes for the father as well!

My favorite argument that the pro choice movement has tried to shove down the people's throats is the ridiculous idea that they're doing the child some sort of service by sparing them what would be an obviously horrible life.   I hate to break it to you people but we live in one of the wealthiest most opportunity-rich times of human existence.   Can we really be so arrogant to think that this child, having grown up, would look back and wish they had been aborted?   That life was just too hard for them and their parents should've known better than to bring them into it?   Everyone deserves the opportunity to make the best out of life as they see fit.   People are born into poverty stricken scenarios everyday and still some of them thrive.   Not all, but some, and they deserve that chance to make it a good life, to dazzle the world with their unique persona and ideas.

Now she's an exception, but how do you know one of the babies who was just aborted while I'm typing this wasn't another exception?   Don't they deserve their day in the sun?!?   How DARE you deny it to them!?

Overpopulation?   The absurdity of this one is so far out there I really hate even lending credence to it by mentioning it.   Can we all just stop right here and agree that regardless of how populated the world ever gets, murdering human beings (especially our own) is never the answer?

Although we are no one to judge others, and morality is a completely subjective thing, I have strong feelings against abortion in most cases. At least nowadays there are plenty of methods of contraception, we should work on raising awareness about ways of planning pregnancy, educating people. If a woman doesn't want to have children or simply isn't ready yet, she should work on preventing pregnancy to occur on the first place. Sure, contraceptive methods can fail at times, but combining various methods and being disciplined about it puts the risk to minimum.   However, there are cases where the situation was out of the woman's control, like rape. In that case, I can absolutely understand the desire of the woman to abort, even thought the child is in no way guilty of anything. Another situation where abortion is perfectly acceptable is when the pregnancy is any way putting in danger the mother to be. Again, I must repeat, morality is purely subjective, what is wrong for one, may be perfectly acceptable for another.","Nothing in this world is purely black or white,",against,[23]

Studies show that the sense of touch in an unborn child is so acute that if a single human hair is drawn across an unborn baby’s palm, it causes it to make a fist. 
Studies also show that when surgeons enter the womb to perform “corrective procedures” on these unborn children, they've witnessed the babies flinch, jerk, and recoil from the sharp objects and incisions. So there are the facts that disprove the whole “they can’t feel pain” opinion.
 The Greeks and Romans were the first to advance a theory of sensation, the idea that the brain and nervous system have a role in producing the perception of pain. If a woman does not wish to be pregnant, then she should take the necessary precautions to prevent that, a.K.A. Not having sex.
Abortion is the brutal murder of an innocent human being and yes, our government has a duty to prevent crimes like that. 

And people often debate what constitutes as life. How is the state of life ambiguous? Cells are living things aren't they? Zygotes are cells which means they’re alive, right? That blastocyst (which is basically a ball of cells) is alive because cells are alive. Fetuses are already alive at the moment of conception.

That earliest point to have an abortion is five to six weeks. Week 5 starts the ""embryonic period."" This is when all the baby's major systems and structures develop.
During the five to six week period is when blood cells, kidney cells, and nerve cells develop. The external features begin to form and so does the brain, spinal cord, heart, and gastrointestinal tract. 
At 43 days (6 weeks, 1 day) electrical brain wave patterns can be recorded. This is ample evidence that “thinking” is taking place inside the brain. 
At 42 days, the skeleton is complete and reflexes are present.
During that whole sixth-seventh week the following happens: Arm and leg buds start to grow. Your baby's brain forms into five different areas. Some cranial nerves are visible. Eyes and ears begin to form. Tissue grows that will become your baby's spine and other bones. Baby's heart continues to grow and now beats at a regular rhythm. Blood pumps through the main vessels.

If this does not make you believe that there is life inside the mother's womb, then I simply do not know what to tell you. If you do accept that there is life there, yet still wish to terminate it, then that is simply sickening. 

Personally, I hope and pray that someday this world will come to its senses and abolish the criminal act of abortion.",Respect ALL Life,against,"[24, 16]"

The human fetus is a batch of living cells containing human DNA necessary for the growth of human brain, heart, limbs, bones, and other human features. It's a fact that the fetus is a very early stage of human development. To say that the fetus isn't a human or a person is denying that fact. It's nonsensical to draw that random line and say that a fetus isn't a human within a human female body until birth. That is irrational to say the least. The argument that a fetus isn't a human or it's not murder because it doesn't have thoughts, consciousness, and doesn't feel pain is absurd. The fact is that from the moment a human sperm and human egg meet, a human zygote is formed with the DNA information to grow and develop into a human. Killing the zygote or the fetus make no difference because they both contain human DNA just as a two month old human baby does. It's murder to intentionally the two month old baby so why is it not murder to kill a fetus or a human zygote for that matter? They're all just different stages of human development.

However, the government should not totally ban abortion. There are certain exceptions. For example, a woman who got raped should be allowed to abort. It was not her idea to carry a baby. Also, a person can get an abortion if the baby might kill them. If these are not the cases, other women should not be allowed to abort. If I allowed myself to have sexual intercourse with someone, (even if I am in my teens) I could not surrender myself into an abortion. It was my choice and I have to suffer the consequences.

Read C.S Lewis's Matter of Abortion. It is about a demon writing a letter to another demon on how they think abortion is right. 
           In the article, Matter of Abortion, the author proclaims that humans have a right to deny the freedom to life. The reason the author gives us the right is because he feels we have rights over our own body. The author feels if a woman finds out she is pregnant unplanned, and she feels that the baby inside will ruin her chance in life, she automatically decides to deny the life of her own flesh and blood for her own benefit. God’s gift of life is precious. In our selfish world, humans believe they have the liberty to do whatever they please, to please themselves and to make their lives better. People are easily led to believe that they have authority over their own body, to take a life to make their life better, even if it means taking away a precious gift. In the article, Matter of Abortion, the author says:   “With creative cunning, we have corrupted, ‘loving our neighbor as self’ into ‘sparing my neighbor from any discomfort I would want to be spared from.’ Since I would want my daughter spared from the punishment- as one of statesmen have called it- of an unplanned pregnancy, I will not deny my neighbor’s daughter the same relief.”   The goal of abortion is to rid the ‘discomfort’. In the eyes of the devil, “abortion does the cause no good, unless it delivers souls to the nether banquet.” If all their (evil) work succeeds only in the death of the baby, for which the mother later feels remorse and seeks forgiveness, they have failed miserably. What they seek in abortion is not only the death of a baby, but the feeling of the inability for forgiveness. They want her to feel lost, alone and disgraceful. To fulfill the hopelessness of any possibility to be loved again or be forgiven. They want her to be isolated from everything and everyone, especially from God.   But what the devil doesn't understand is that God forgives. He is ultimately, true love. His grace is unconditional, and He forgives.
Acts 13:38 says: Therefore, my friends, I want you to know that through Jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you. Through Christ, our Savior, we can be saved. We can be forgiven through Him. Look at the Apostle Paul. He was murdering Christians for their faith. God confronted him, and Paul repented. He was washed from his sins, through the blood of Christ. Because Christ died for us, we now have a way to be saved.",Life vs. Death,against,[18]

Murder is the “unlawful killing of a human being” with some level of intent. California law includes “a deliberate intention unlawfully to take away the life of a fellow creature.”

The only thing preventing abortion from being included in the definition of murder is that it’s currently not “unlawful.” But basic science proves that an unborn child is a “human being.” No mention of “personhood” is necessary for basic murder definitions. Killing a “human being” or a “fellow creature,” even, is enough.

Why, as a society, do we pick and choose human beings whom we can deliberately kill? These human beings are fully human, entirely innocent, and helpless and voiceless. Yet we purposely target them, setting very few restrictions on their killings.

Is there any other class of human beings that our society will make it “lawful” to kill? Belgium is already on the path to extending legal murder through its legalization of euthanasia – even child euthanasia. History shows that Nazi Germany, once it began to legalize the murder of human beings, simply continued down the path – the elderly, the sick, the disabled, gypsies, homosexuals, the Jews, those who defended the Jews. Where would it have stopped?

This is why abortion must be illegal if murder is illegal. It should never be “lawful” to kill any innocent human being.

Using safe sex is PROVEN to help prevent not only STD'S, but pregnancy. If you choose to be smart with your sex life, then you chose the freedom to not get pregnant. 2. Sexual abstinence. Abstinence is the fact or practice of restraining oneself from indulging in something. You chose to not use engage in sexual activity for the fact of preventing pregnancy, catching a STD, don't see sex as enjoyable until marriage, or the fact you're saving it for someone you honestly, truly love and want a child. 3. Choosing to not use safe sex/birth control. In this world, we have a thing called free will. Free will is something people use to their advantage. Either it be good, or bad you deal with the outcome of it. If you choose to use safe sex, pregnancy is much, much, lower chance of pregnancy.   99% effective. 4. Making adult, mature, and aware of what can happen. It is mostly adults in our society who raise children and made the choice to do so. If you are willing to make adult decision, it's time to start acting like one. That is what pro-choice should be. If you are willing to engage in sexual activity without protection, you know the HUGE risk of pregnancy will be there. That's what comes along with engaging in sex without protection. Having a child is not a consequence, it is a blessing. And for the record I am against abortion due to morals, not religious beliefs. Abortion in a lot of ways shows irresponsibility, excludes safe sex in the form of being able to prevent pregnancy. Pro abortion people say the following. 1. Just a clump of cells. Well us as humans have how many billion cells? 2. It has the ""potential"" of being a baby. Well, then you are killing potential life. 3. A fetus lacks brain function. Well, so do the mentally retarded and autistic. Should we kill them for lacking brain function? 4. A fetus is a parasite. Well, a human fetus does NOT fit the scientific term for it.

Two: unborn babies are still life, like cells, but this life could lead to another human being, someone who can grow up to have their own opinions and think for themselves.

A very large percentage of rapes occur because the girl was out late, partying, or drinking and using substances that caused her to not really know what was going on.

Some argue that a fetus cannot FEEL pain until the 28th week. - Bare in mind, it's another assumption. -   But let's remove the nature of FEELINGS. How else can you experience pain? Well it can be in an uncomfortable position that can be caused by vacuum aspiration or suction termination (abortion methods) - fits the definition of pain.-, not be able to decide what to do with its own life, its quality of life being undermined etc. The fetus doesn't know this no, but we do.

Definition of life ; 'The condition that distinguishes animals and plants from inorganic matter, including the capacity for growth, reproduction, functional'
Definition of pregnant/pregnancy ; 'Having a child or young developing in the uterus.'
Definition of fetus ; 'the developing young in the uterus, specifically the unborn offspring in the postembryonic period, in humans from nine weeks after fertilization until birth.' 
Definition of abortion ; 'The deliberate termination of a human pregnancy.'
Definition of murder ; 'The premeditated killing of one human being by another.'
Definition of kill ; 'Cause the death of (a person, animal, or other living thing).'

Note that the definition of life doesn't include 'living things' but rather 'growing' things to which a fetus as a 'developing', hence growing, complies with. A fetus is a LIFE. Human is LIFE. Murder is killing a LIFE.

God requires us to obey His sixth commandment, ""You shall not murder"" (Exodus 20:13; Deuteronomy 5:17).

ETC

But, Do all of those reason have the same importance? We need to simplify... What is the fundamental question? The fundamental question is whether the embryo is a person o not.

If the embryo is not a person, women will decide what they want... Anyone can choose for them, if abortion has risks is their life. Is like jump with a parachute from an airplane. It is their decision.

But if it is a person, that live should be protected.

There are two objective reasons to think that that is a person.

The continuity argument
We need a start up point that everybody agree: ""All of you are people""
A Question: a second before, Were you a person? Yes of course.
And yesterday, Were you a person? Yes of course.
Therefore, Since when you were a person? The exact time, please. 
When you were born? But you were the same that one second before. There was not a qualitative change. What happened at that moment from the embryo point of view? Only that he began to breathe through the lungs. But the embryo was the same one second before. Therefore it is not the point that we are looking for. 

And what about when it was inside the woman. It is a continuous process, so there is any point that it could became from a no-person to a person. Why? Because you can not be a 90% person, or you are a person o you aren't. Or you can be murder or not. There is no intermediate points. A continuous process can not be joint with a discrete process. It is not a solid argument. It is not philosophically coherent.

So, when did you became a person? At the conception. Why? Because you get a new DNA, different from your parents. At that moment, you have defined your sex, your skin colour, your facial features, and a lot of hereditary traits. Is it a enough qualitative change? Of course it is.

Read C.S Lewis's Matter of Abortion. It is about a demon writing a letter to another demon on how they think abortion is right. 
           In the article, Matter of Abortion, the author proclaims that humans have a right to deny the freedom to life. The reason the author gives us the right is because he feels we have rights over our own body. The author feels if a woman finds out she is pregnant unplanned, and she feels that the baby inside will ruin her chance in life, she automatically decides to deny the life of her own flesh and blood for her own benefit. God’s gift of life is precious. In our selfish world, humans believe they have the liberty to do whatever they please, to please themselves and to make their lives better. People are easily led to believe that they have authority over their own body, to take a life to make their life better, even if it means taking away a precious gift. In the article, Matter of Abortion, the author says:   “With creative cunning, we have corrupted, ‘loving our neighbor as self’ into ‘sparing my neighbor from any discomfort I would want to be spared from.’ Since I would want my daughter spared from the punishment- as one of statesmen have called it- of an unplanned pregnancy, I will not deny my neighbor’s daughter the same relief.”   The goal of abortion is to rid the ‘discomfort’. In the eyes of the devil, “abortion does the cause no good, unless it delivers souls to the nether banquet.” If all their (evil) work succeeds only in the death of the baby, for which the mother later feels remorse and seeks forgiveness, they have failed miserably. What they seek in abortion is not only the death of a baby, but the feeling of the inability for forgiveness. They want her to feel lost, alone and disgraceful. To fulfill the hopelessness of any possibility to be loved again or be forgiven. They want her to be isolated from everything and everyone, especially from God.   But what the devil doesn't understand is that God forgives. He is ultimately, true love. His grace is unconditional, and He forgives.
Acts 13:38 says: Therefore, my friends, I want you to know that through Jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you. Through Christ, our Savior, we can be saved. We can be forgiven through Him. Look at the Apostle Paul. He was murdering Christians for their faith. God confronted him, and Paul repented. He was washed from his sins, through the blood of Christ.

P4) Abortion infringes on the fetus's right to life
C2) Therefore, Abortion should be prohibited by the Government.

Defense of my Premises

P1)
The UDHR and the Constitution would concur with this.

P2)
I would say that it is quite obvious that a fetus is innocent, as it has done nothing immoral. The crux of the premiss is whether fetuses are in fact human beings. I believe that an acceptable definition of “Human Being” is “a culture-bearing primate classified in the genus Homo, especially the species H. Sapiens,” as given by Encyclopaedia Britannica.

It is a biological fact that fetuses belong to kind “homo sapiens.” So, by definition, they are human beings. 

C1) Follows from the 2 premisses.

P3)
This premiss is echoed by the Declaration of Independence, which says, “that to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men.” 

If the government’s role is to secure rights of its citizens, then obviously, it should outlaw that which infringes on someone’s rights.

P4)
Given that a fetus has a right to life, killing it is obviously infringing upon it’s right to life.

992,992,1582734815-1328,https://www.debate.org/opinions/is-abortion-wrong,"The question assumes that wrong means morally unacceptable. Abortion, as an action in and of itself, is the termination of a living organism that would, if left to incubate and mature, grow into a larger organism. In the case of humans, it would grow into a baby. So terminating that child's existence is murder, and therefore, it is wrong.
People might have heard the ""Bald Eagle Argument"" - how it's illegal to destroy an eagle's egg, and if done so, it could come at a high price, due to the near-extinct status of the eagle. Law makers and animal activists are aware that the destruction of the egg, though it has not developed into a mature chick, is the destruction of life, and a precious one at that. I think the same can be said for any other rare creature: Polar Bears, Pandas, even some sea animals.
So what's the difference? 
I believe, for some, it's a matter of convenience - a child might ruin my career/life, we don't have enough money, I did not plan for this child, and a host of other thoughts. Abortion is wrong. Does that mean it has to be illegal? No.   It can be legal, but restricted, in the same way prescription medicine is restricted (or it should be).

It only enables us to think about ourselves, and what is ""best"" for us. I hope us women will consider the consequences of our actions before we take them, so that we won't end another's life for our own convenience.
In regards to rape, I also stand anti-abortion. However, like I said earlier, to legalize abortion is to cause women to turn to dangerous practices, possibly even ending their own lives, due to the evil actions of a man/men (in regards to rape). I do not think that is the route to take. Instead, keep it legal, but we should take active steps as a society to stop rape at all costs. Men should protect women, and women should be on guard, knowing what is at stake. Families should teach their children to be cautious and mindful of their surroundings.

The point I am making is even if you ban abortion, some women will still kill their baby.   Banning abortion won't end it, it may even increase the amount of women having abortion.

Now that I have clarified abortion can't really be stopped, even if it is rendered illegal, I am now going to state what my opinion is on abortion.

I support women having abortion under one condition, that one condition is they must have tubal ligation if they desire to have an abortion. My argument is women who have an abortion or want to have one obviously don't value human life, otherwise they wouldn't want to kill the developing human. A woman who does not value human life makes a terrible mother, why should we allow women who have had abortions to have children in the future when they have already shown they don't mind killing their own child. Children should never have to have a terrible mother, I think we can all agree on that matter.

To summarise my point, abortions should remain legal under the premise that women who have abortions will also receive tubal ligation to prevent them from having children in the future because having an abortion indicates the woman doesn't value human life, doesn't mind having her child be killed, and proves she is an unfit mother because the last thing you want to do is have a child live with a mother who has killed one or more of her children in the past.",I support abortion under one condition.,against,[16]

I understand that because childbirth is amazing it takes it's toll, but nevertheless, it is amazing. When you are giving birth, you are creating a human person. When you look at a picture of your average fetus, it doesn't look like a person, but it could certainly grow up to be one.

Now that all of that's been said, I can return to my original statement: ""... It's not always about the mother.""

A train is barreling through on the other side of a part of the track with a damsel in distress tied on to the track, cartoon style (or whoever really). If you push the person next to you off the bridge onto the track it will slow the train so that it has time to brake, and save the damsel. Would you do it? Well, the thing is, the damsel, in this case, the unborn person, has more life left to live than the person next to you, the mother and is totally innocent of any wrongdoing. This damsel's life is worth more than the reputation or quality of life of the person next to you. You should push the person (the mother) off the bridge, basically ruining their life for a TEMPORARY time, a time from which they can rise up from.

So are you saying murder and killing is the right solution to this? It's just like saying, since this country has too many people, we have to kill those people who are no use to this world and those who don't help our economy grow.
I've seen many people say it's just a glob of cells we are aborting here, not a person who can rationalize and do complicated things. Just remember, that's how we were before. And our mothers and fathers out there probably never called that gift in your mother's womb a ""glob of cells"". That who you are calling a glob of cells could have become a child, a hero, a president, or a leader. If you kill your newborn child, and you kill your unborn child, what's the difference? Isn't it still murder or killing? Does the age of the human decide who's death is more important or grave? No! So that child you might have aborted had that possibility of becoming a hero or president. Think about it.
Okay, next, many said it is the choice of the woman or mother, since they have the right. But do we humans really have the right to tamper with life and death? We do not. As I said, that who is in your womb is a human nevertheless. It will grow up and have its own rights too. If we really get to decide, ""Okay, the first baby get aborted and die. The second one, I think let us keep it."" That's unfair, and so unjust!"" We humans cannot decide what to do with a life. And yes, that unborn child is a life too. 
Many argued on responsibility, like what if the person did not think about having a child and wasn't prepared to raise it up? Okay. How do we get pregnant again? Sex. Sex is a choice; it was made so we could have children and reproduce. Sex want made to satisfy our desires and pleasures nor to please us. It was mainly for reproduction. And now, if you really don't want to get pregnant, simple! Then don't have sex! Think first- do you have the needs and capability of raising a child? If you don't, then don't even have sex, because sex is for reproduction. Just like why would you buy a book if you are not going to read it at all? Think of it that way.

So is abortion murder? Is a fetus a human being? Yes. In fact, the moment human life begins IS at conception. Don't believe me? The medical field seems to support my view (http://thechart.blogs.cnn.com/2011/11/07/medical-views-when-does-human-life-begin/). To further support my reasoning, we can all agree that a baby is a human. That baby was human at the time of birth, which means that it must have been human 5 minutes before the birth. So if the baby is a human before birth, then that means that it is a human while it is a fetus. If it is a human while it’s a fetus, then it wouldn't matter if the growing fetus were nine months, nine weeks, or nine days old, it is still human.

Now that we established that the fetus is a human, let’s take a look at what these arguments made by the pro-abortionist look like when we substitute the unborn baby with a two-year-old, since both are human.

Killing two-year-olds can actually save the world by reducing the increasing overpopulation!

It is the mother’s choice to kill the two-year-old, nobody can tell her otherwise!

The innocent two-year-old should be killed because of the crimes of his/her father.

If the woman cannot provide for and raise the two-year-old (as if adoption is out of the picture) then she has the right to kill it.

Women should have the right to choose whether or not to kill two-year-olds!

Killing two-year-olds should be legal!

If the two-year-old is not given the best chance possible to live a good life, then it would be a moral service to kill him/her.

If war (even waged to prevent the rise of mass genocide and global terrorism) is so widely accepted, then why isn’t killing two-year-olds?

If we are allowed to kill animals, then why not kill two-year-olds?

If the two-year-old is unconscious, then it is OK to kill him/her!

The two-year-old should die because of a poor decision made by his/her parents.

Because a woman has to endure sufferings of life (periods, pain), then the two-year-old should be killed!

Because the woman thinks that the two-year-old would not live a good life, he/she should be killed.

Who are you to try to keep a woman from killing a two-year-old, you immoral and inconsiderate person!

The parents don’t want the two-year-old, so it is ok to kill it.

I hardly think that anyone in their right mind, especially the law, would support the killing of toddlers under any circumstance, so why is an unborn child any different? Probably the most leading argument for abortion is the possibility of pregnancy by rape. While yes, it is possible, and sadly does happen, honestly, does it happen often enough that killing a child should be legalized for everyone? Let’s pull some numbers.

Sadly, 1/6 American Women are or will be rape victims (http://www.rainn.org/get-information/statistics/sexual-assault-victims), but that also reduces the percentage down to a rounded 17 percent of women.

So with 83 percent of the woman population excluded how many actually get pregnant from rape? Some studies have shown numbers as high as a rounded eight percent will get pregnant, while others show lower numbers such as 3.1 to five percent (http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/health/2012/08/21/todd-akin-challenged-by-doctors-on-rape-and-pregnancy/). Once again, I will give the benefit of a doubt and go with the rounded eight percent, which leaves us with 1.36 percent of all women will be pregnant by rape, hopefully even much lower than that. 

While rape is a sad issue, it still does not justify the murder of an innocent child. Plus, even if abortion were to be legalized for the sake of rape victims, then that would enable the other 98.64 percent of the women population to kill the unborn child for any of the other reasons previously mentioned.

Besides, studies have once again shown that the main motives behind abortion are not because of rape after all, as pro-abortionists make it out to be. Allow me to quote some statistics from a study on these motives;

“The results showed that more than half of the women expressed that a bad relationship with the partner in one way or another was a motive for the abortion. Other important motives included characteristics of the women and their partners, mainly immaturity, work/studies and unsuitable life situation for having a child. Less common motives seemed to be economy, dwelling and medical and health factors.” http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8038886

So is abortion really all about the rape victims, or the not responsible teenagers and bad relationships with the man that will be the motives behind all the unjustifiable and numerous counts of murders against helpless and innocent babies? Besides, government was our nation not built on the idea that everybody (including the unborn) should have rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness?

So the time frame of which the baby has been developing (and I say developing instead of alive, because any growing organism is alive regardless of stage) is not an issue. The issue is not whether the baby will live outside the womb. The issue is that we are killing very young humans before they are considered to have proper rights like, for one, the right to life, and the right to a chance at life, which without interference from other humans, would continue normally. It is not as if the baby did something to deserve death. The baby is just acting normally, as it is programmed to do. Every one deserves a chance.

In the past 40 years, abortion has claimed more than 55 million lives. In Pennsylvania alone, an unborn child dies every 15 minutes in an abortion.

It is precisely facts like these that convince me - and so many in my generation - that abortion is unnecessary and wrong.

The facts show all too plainly how any of my siblings, friends or classmates could have been killed before they had a chance to be born. And they make me wonder how many of my peers I will never know.

In January of 1973 when the U.S. Supreme Court issued its abortion ruling in Roe v. Wade, young women did not have access to the facts about abortion that we have today. Nor did they have the perspective of looking back over 40 years of data showing the consequences of abortion on demand.

My generation does.

In the past 40 years, studies have shown that abortion is common, unsafe, and frequently the result of outside pressure on women.

We now know that at the moment of conception, the human embryo is a complete, unique life.

We now know that more than half of women who had abortions felt pressured into the decision.

We now know that most women have abortions for social reasons such as relationship issues, finances, career or education, lack of readiness for the responsibility.

We now know that hundreds of women have died and thousands more have been injured by ""safe,"" legal abortions.

We now know, thanks to a pro-life leader of my generation, that abortion facilities cover up sexual abuse, give incorrect information, and perform abortions simply because of a baby's gender.

These facts point to the injustice of abortion - both for women and unborn babies. These are the facts that motivate me and so many other young people to advocate for the vulnerable.

Take, for example, my childhood friend Ashley, who spends an exhaustive number of hours in her community promoting the value of every human life. In her gentle, compassionate way, she reaches out to expecting and new mothers and counsels post-abortive women. The spare time she has is dedicated to loving and caring for her severely disabled brother - and making sure everyone knows how valuable his life is, too.

And there is Hope, a vibrant, intelligent young woman whose passion for social justice is leading her to law school and nursing school. She plans to dedicate her expertise in both fields to the defense of life in the womb.

As young women, we know - not just believe - that abortion is wrong. After living our whole lives in a society that devalues life, we know that something needs to change.

2. You can't kill someone just because it is convenient to you.

Another aspect – is a religion. Of course everybody choose their own religion. However there is no religion, which approve abortion. Children are the gifts of a God. It means that   God wishes the child will be born. So when we kill the fetus, we deny someone a chance to exist in the world.

It's not weighing eight pounds or having a developed brain, because that would mean that an adult is more human than a five-year old. Being human is in our DNA, and a fetus is genetically a human. Can you really say that ending the life of a creature who despite its lack of experience can already sense light, can already hear the sound of your voice and has developed eyebrows is ok? The fetus was human from the very beginning, but for those who think differently, those are the characteristics of a fetus twenty two weeks in. In most states abortion is legal until twenty four to twenty six weeks in. How can you deny that a fetus who can already sense different things is human? As a society we choose not to see it because it's a comfortable choice, it's the easy way out not having to face our responsibilities. The government accepts it because it has become common, it's what the people want and it generates   a huge amount of profits. But the outcome of the whole situation must not make us overlook the moral issues behind it. We must face our responsibilities. We know that sexual intercourse leads to pregnancy, so why must a human life end because of the consequences of our actions? It is no better than murder. Even in horrific cases such as rape, there are always alternate options such as adoption, but abortion is never the answer. Of course there are extreme cases in which the mother's health is at risk, but it's a completely different case.",What makes us human?,against,"[16, 24]"

The rape matter. I would say ""pro-choice,"" but then again, abortion is murder. During the fourth-fifth week—the egg is JUST fertilized—the baby's organs, brain, and spine, begin to form. During the sixth week, the heart is already pumping blood. Aren't heartbeats what determine a life?

The woman may also be unfit to be a mother, whether it's due to age, behavior, etc. People would say adoption is the worst-case scenario, but a woman does not have to send a baby straight to a foster home.

I understand what you are saying but I think the huge problem is that people don't understand what exactly happens in an abortion.   It is easy to say that something is okay if they are ignorant of what is really happening.   Abortion is legal in many states up to 24 weeks which means that glob of cells, as so many on here have called it,   has a fully formed face with eybrows and eyelashes.   The process to abort this ""glob of cells"" , because it is too big to just be vaccumed out, starts with forceps that have to crush the skull, spine, and pelvis in order to get it out.   It also doesn't come out in one piece. 
If the ""glob of cells"" is prematurely born at 24 weeks, with modern day medicine, it has a 75-80% chance of living.   So if the ""glob of cells"" is born at 24 weeks, is it still a glob of cells until the end of that week?   Technically the mom should still be able to decide if the Dr should crush the ""glob of cells""   with his forceps until the end of the 24th week.   
Also when would that ""glob of cells"" technically become a baby? When you said ""Negative feelings associated with harming others and empathy are simply the result of evolution,"" I find that a bit funny because we also have instincts like you said and a brain.   When we feel pain, our instincts naturally say make the pain stop.   Even the little ""glob of cells"" can feel pain starting between 20 and 22 weeks.

3) Where's the baby's choice? And don't give me that ""it can't know what's happening."" Can I ask you what you remember as a little infant? No much, I can tell you. Well, it's the same concept here. Should parents be able to murder their infants because they wouldn't know what's going on? A sane person would say no.

Women use it as a way to get rid of pregnancies that could have been prevented had they chosen other methods of contraception or even not to have sex at all, but that's not the only reason. 
Let's take a look at it this way. Let's say you have a daughter, fourteen, young and beautiful. She has a boyfriend, but they don't do anything because she wants to be safe and she knows she's NOT READY to have a child at that age. Your young daughter is suddenly and unexpectedly raped--by the boyfriend who did not want to wait, someone on the street who saw her and felt he was entitled to doing whatever he wanted to her, or somebody she thought she could trust and evidently could not. However it happened, it happened, and now she has to deal with the consequences. Are you going to tell your fourteen year old daughter that her rape was God's will? Are you going to tell her that it's okay that sex was forced onto her, that she was hurt and violated but the child's life is more important than hers so she's a damn shame and disappointment if she wants to abort it? Are you going to force your CHILD to carry another child inside of her? Any teenager who is pregnant is more than likely exposed to several kinds of bullying and mistreatment for it, because she's seen as a disgusting slut no matter the situation. How is it fair to make a child go through that when the situation is not her fault? How is it fair to put more value in the fetus' life than the life of the female who is already living? Taking the option of abortion away from rape victims, especially teenagers, not only presents them to harsh treatment and scorn from their peers but also takes them away from school and the life they were supposed to be living before the pregnancy. Forcing pregnant females to carry through an unwanted pregnancy takes away from their ability to live their own life, which already exists. Teens drop out of school, are kicked out of homes. Adults can be shamed and scorned in their workplaces for ""getting themselves pregnant."" 
Excuse me? Can a woman get herself pregnant? No, it's not her fault. Why are you placing all the blame on the women? Does anybody pro-life seem to consider the fact that most often men are completely to blame for abortions? Is it a woman's fault when she's been raped? No. Is it a woman's fault when her husband or boyfriend did not want to listen to ""I'm not ready"" or ""I don't want a child"" and chose to do what he wanted?

Another thing I'd like to point out is that while pro choice gives a variety of reasons, the pro lifers can only give three: Murder, God, and ""you wouldn't like it"". Life begins at birth, because birth is the only time when a fetus is developed to the point where it CAN be alive. Yes, there's a heartbeat. Yes, there's functioning organs. But the stuff making the fetus is only preparing it for activation. And perhaps we're wrong, maybe it is alive, and abortion is murder.

Another thing: Drugs are illegal, but we use them anyway. Certain weapons are illegal, but some people have them anyway(Ex: ak47).

Self-actualization includes morality, creativity and problem solving skills. Aside from unwanted pregnancies that spurn from intimate sexual relationships, many women become impregnated as a result of rape. If a woman is raped, then she should undoubtedly have the right to abort a child that was a product of sexual assault.

How can Human RIghts only apply in minimal circumstances? These people are saying 'No, abortions are murder.' Yet these foetus don't have the right to be victims to such crimes as manslaughter? Or murder?

It is the not the place of government to legislate against woman's choices. A woman's right to choose abortion is a ""fundamental right"". Motherhood must never be a punishment for having sexual intercourse. Do we have the right to force the mother to keep the baby solely because she consented to participate in these sexual activities? Do we have the right to take away another""s right as we continue to fight for other rights? Why do we take away the rights of a woman because she has the potential to have a baby? Every woman has the right to do whatever they want with their body aka Bodily Autonomy. This is one of the reasons why it is illegal to take organs from the deceased that have not signed off permission. If we continue this right after life, why do we strip it from a pregnant woman? Why would you grant a dead person a right that you wouldn't give to someone that is alive. Legal abortions protect women's health. Legal abortion not only protects women's lives, it also protects their health. For tens of thousands of women with heart disease, kidney disease, severe hypertension, sickle-cell anemia and severe diabetes, and other illnesses that can be life-threatening, the availability of legal abortion has helped avert serious medical complications that could have resulted from childbirth. Before legal abortion, such women's choices were limited to dangerous illegal abortion or dangerous childbirth. Being a mother is just one option for women. Many hard battles have been fought to win political and economic equality for women. These gains will not be worth much if reproductive choice is denied. To be able to choose a safe, legal abortion makes many other options possible. Otherwise an accident or a rape can end a woman's economic and personal freedom. Even when precautions are taken, accidents can and do happen. For some families, this is not a problem. But for others, such an event can be catastrophic. An unintended pregnancy can increase tensions, disrupt stability, and push people below the line of economic survival. Family planning is the answer. All options must be open.
•	Raising a child is not an easy task & requires social & emotional commitment coupled with financial resources. As such if a person feels they are not ready for a child, it means the pregnancy is unwanted & resultant allowing a fetus to grow into a child is worse than abortion since the resultant child will grow in a non-conducive & destructive environment without the love, care & stability that a child needs. Abortion prevent unwanted & unplanned pregnancies which prevents child neglect since the mother does not want to have children at that moment in time. Making abortion illegal will increase teenage pregnancy (children having children).",It's Common Sense People,for,"[1, 5, 11]"

I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; rather, she is to remain quiet.

2) if a woman is not financially stable she shouldn't have a child she cant support. If she is low on money that means she probably has to work hard to support herself, having a baby means she'd have to work even harder and then that is going to reduce the amount of time spent with the child.

She will relive the rape every time she looks at   her kid, and cannot love him or her as a mother should. Think about the consequences for both the mother and the kid- feelings of abandonment and agitation. To those who claim there is a reason why women get raped, I agree- they get raped because the rapist can get away with it- so what if a child is born? They don't have to take care of it as the mother has to. The victim is bearing the dire consequences of someone else's actions, when there can and should be a choice if she wants to keep the child.

Abortion should remain legal because if you think about most people who try to argue against this in government are MEN when WOMEN are the ones that are affected.   A fetus is only able to live because it is attached to the womb of the mother; therefore, any claim to a ""right"" to live must necessarily be at the expense of the woman. It is not independent.

Do you want to know what pisses me off? Ireland, a supposedly progressive nation, still forces women to carry all pregnancies to term unless her life is in risk. That a Chilean government official said and I quote, that   a woman must carry her pregnancy to term “even if it will kill her.” That a woman traumatized by a brutal rape can be forced to deliver the product of that crime in over 90 countries. That it is men deciding whether women have a right to control their own bodies. That a dead corpse has more rights than a pregnant women in the eyes of those that oppose abortion.
What is abortion? Abortion is “the deliberate termination of a human pregnancy,” according to Oxford Dictionary. It is arguably the most controversial issue of our times. But why? Well, pro lifers believe that termination of a pregnancy kills a human being, and all fetuses have a right to be born and live. Pro choice believe that it should be a woman’s right to chose what happens to her body. And so here is the question: Should a woman have the right to terminate her pregnancy?
	When the issue is first approached, each sides have a decent argument. Hell, I used to be prolife. But as I started reading into the subject, I realised how ridiculous a ban on abortions would be, and how dangerous. In the 1950s and 60s in America, between 200,000 and 1.2 million illegal abortions were performed and as many as 5,000 women died PER YEAR from these. This was before Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion in the states So clearly, whether abortions are legal or not, they are still going to happen. So why not make them safe and legal?
	But beyond the health issues involved with a ban on abortions, what about human rights. Did you know that no one can force you to donate organs or tissue, even if it could save a thousand lives.   You can’t even use organs from a corpse without written consent from the person when they were alive. Seems logical right? Everybody should have the right to decide who uses their body. There’s this concept called bodily autonomy. The UN declared it as a human right, and it basically states that a person has control over who or what uses their body, for what, and for how long. So what’s this got to do with pregnancy?",Bodily Freaking Autonomy (not to mention a list of other things) p1,for,"[6, 1]"

However, there is a way to lower the amount of abortions that happen without the mother risking her life at a backstreet abortion clinic, or Terrorists and Extremist organizations such as the Army of God killing innocent people such as women, the baby, and men in favor of abortion.

The reason I voted to make abortion legal is I have though of a system. This is only hypothetical, but what if there was a law where before a woman can get on abortion, she has to go to a counsellor. I mean anger and fear can cloud the mind and make us do things we don't want or mean to do, right? Therefore, what if a woman doesn't want an abortion? What if she is just scared, wants to fix her problem and thinks that there is no other option. Well that's where the counsellor comes in. The woman can tell the counsellor about her situation and the counsellor can give her options and tell her (based on her situation) what the best option is. For example, with a situation like rape, a woman is usually scared and wants an abortion. However, if she goes to a counsellor, the counsellor can help her to realize that she has other options such as adoption and that she may not have to abort. The illegal part is not getting the abortion, the illegal part is not going to the counsellor to see otherwise. However, if a woman still feels that she wants an abortion, she should be able to get one. It's her decision and NOT to be rude, but her fault if something goes wrong or she changes her mind too late.

By using this system, women can make more sober minded thoughts and can use other options besides abortion.

Personally, a fetus is a baby the second it can live outside the womb. Until then, the fetus is just a parasite, and the woman has the right to remove it. Not allowing a woman is this right is basically giving her less rights than a dead person. See, theres this   concept called ""bodily autonomy"". Its generally considered a human right. Bodily autonomy means a person has control over who or what uses their body, for what, and for how long. Its why you can’t be forced to donate blood, tissue, or organs. Even if you are dead. Even if you’d save or improve 20 lives. It’s why someone can’t touch you, have sex with you, or use your body in any way without your continuous consent.

A fetus is using someone’s body parts. Therefore under bodily autonomy, it is there by permission, not by right. It needs a persons continuous consent. If they deny and withdraw their consent, the pregnant person has the right to remove them from that moment. A fetus is equal in this regard because if I need someone else’s body parts to live, they can also legally deny me their use.

By saying a fetus has a right to someone’s body parts until it’s born, despite the pregnant person’s wishes, you are doing two things.

1. Granting a fetus more rights to other people’s bodies than any born person.

Not all orphans are happy with their lives. Sure, there are some that do live happy lives and people say that at least it gives the baby a chance.

One, you shouldn't let a mistake ruin someone's life. People often make biased judgments about those who make those mistakes. Some may picture them as careless, reckless, whores who bed with many people. I'm not saying all do but it is easy to think of them that way. Why do you think some teenage moms are shamed by people and they are degraded by them. But hey, all humans make mistakes. Some people are genuinely worried and scared for their lives when they find out they are pregnant. They feel immense pressure and regret from their mistake. Secondly, about those who say that the people   shouldn't kill their babies because of their mistakes, you are saying that you should let it live without thinking about what that baby might have to face in the future. Yeah, instead of aborting the still-growing fetus, freeing it from all the suffering it might have to deal with when it grows up, give birth to some accidental baby and dump it in an orphanage cuz hey, it deserves to live.

If the mother decides to do heroine, the baby has a very high chance of psychological disorders, or physical issue(s). Why make your baby live through that hell? You would feel so guilty to know it was your fault you gave the baby issues because of your wrong decision. 

Let's say a mother wants an abortion but is afraid she will get harmed in the process. Well, the answer is simply the fact that you won't. Abortions do not harm the mother, and they will not give the mother long lasting health issues. 

It has been proven with statistics that women who accept abortions are to suffer less psychological problems then women who deny abortions. Women who might say no to abortions could face regret of having a baby they couldn't keep or harmed during their pregnancy process. In September of 2013, a peer study was conducted and 95% of the women who accepted abortions thought it was the right decision.

A study from the University of California conveyed that women who were unable to preform abortions were more likely to stay in a relationship with an abusive partner and were twice as lucky to become victims of domestic abuse/violence.

Another thing that should be brought to mind is that a baby should not come into this world unwanted. Taking care of a child requires consideration, preparation, and planning. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment stated that unintended pregnancies are associated with birth defects, low birth weight, maternal depression, increased risk of child abuse, lower educational attainment, delayed entry into prenatal care, a high risk of physical violence during pregnancy, and reduced rates of breastfeeding. Not to mention, 49% of all pregnancies from American women are unwanted.

Abortion reduces welfare costs to taxpayers. The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan federal agency, evaluated a proposed anti-abortion bill that would ban all abortions nationwide after 20 weeks of pregnancy, and found that the resulting additional births would increase the federal deficit by $225 million over nine years, due to the increased need for Medicaid coverage. Also, since many women seeking late-term abortions are economically disadvantaged, their children are likely to require welfare assistance.

Abortion reduces crime.   According to a study co-written by Freakonomics, Levitt, PhD, and published in the peer-reviewed Quarterly Journal of Economics, ""legalized abortion has contributed significantly to recent crime reductions."" Around 18 years after abortion was legalized, crime rates began to drop abruptly, and crime rates dropped earlier in states that allowed abortion earlier. Because ""women who have abortions are those most at risk to give birth to children who would engage in criminal activity,"" and women who had control over the timing of childbearing were more likely to raise children in optimal environments, crime is reduced when there is access to legal abortion.",I support abortion.,for,"[8, 6, 11, 7, 9, 12, 13]"

It doesn't come down to whether or not a fetus is alive or not alive. It comes down to this 
- ITS HER BODY
So what about the fetus' body? Okay sure, fine, a fetus has a right to life, but a right to life is NOT the same as a right to use someone else's body, which is exactly what a fetus does during a pregnancy. During a pregnancy, the fetus is eating away at the woman's nutrition, taxing her body, and using her organs, which means that the fetus is attached to the woman making it her body that is sustaining life. Since the woman's body is being used to host another living being, the woman should have a say in whether or not she wants to use HER BODY to sustain life.
Let me put it this way
Just like how you and I have a right to choose whether or not we will use OUR bodies to save SOMEONE else's life (via organ donations like bone marrow, kidneys, etc.) a woman should get to choose whether or not she will use HER BODY to sustain life and carry to term. 
At the end of the day - we as citizens in a free country have a right to our own bodies and have a right to refuse to have someone else's will imposed on our own bodies. If the government came to our houses and started harvesting organs without our consent to save someone else, we could all agree that that would be problematic. Imposing abortion bans essentially does the same. You are forcing a woman to use HER body to carry to term and imposing the will of someone else on the woman's body.
So why not adoption?
The cost of health care while pregnant can go as high as 70k, many women cant afford those costs (furthermore, they have to take time of work to focus on their health, and since many companies don't provide paid maternity leave, that is especially problematic.)

Abortion does not kill a person.   The fertilized cell is not a baby, is not a human, and can not be considered a murder because of inaccurate conclusions.

Now I want to address the ''use protection'' argument. Contraception is never 100% effective. Even if you use a condom, an IUD, and take the morning after pill after you have sex there is still a chance of getting pregnant. It's very small, but still there. And a person should have he right to have sex for pleasure and/or emotional bonding without wanting children. 

And by using the logic that aborting an embryo or a fetus which has the potential to become a life is murder, millions of men and women globally are homicidal maniacs, including me and you. Because egg cells have the potential to become a human life, yet they are killed off every month. And men would have it worse. Their sperm cells die constantly, and each of those sperm cells has the potential to become a human life.

Many people argue that if a woman receives an abortion then she is “murdering” her unborn foetus, leading to numerous religious leaders condemning the act. The right for a woman to do so as she pleases with her body is removed whenever a country makes the right to a safe abortion illegal. The loss of safe abortions lead to women trying other ways, such as using coat hangers, with some women going as far as killing themselves. People who condemn abortion forget though, that for some women abortion is the only option. Complications with a foetus can lead to a short life, a life of suffering and sometimes the death of the mother. If abortions are made illegal (which they are in 6 countries) then women who are raped and become pregnant won’t be given the option of terminating the pregnancy, instead having to live with the reminder of the terrible thing that happened to her for the rest of her life; or she might just pray to have a miscarriage. 
“My body, my choice”. “My body, my decision to do whatever I want with it.” If a woman falls pregnant young which wasn’t part of her plan, then she can have the option to terminate the pregnancy.

Prior to America legalising abortions, between 200,000 and 1.2 million girls had had a coat hanger abortion. If abortions are illegalised then the number of unsafe abortions will rise, leading to death in some cases, if performed wrong. In less developed countries, the number of unsafe abortions is higher than that of safe ones.

But, let me also be clear, I don't support abortion itself across the board, but I support the right for the woman to make the decision one way or another.

I don't support people using abortion as a sadistic birth control method, but as per the law (Roe v. Wade), they have the choice to do so or not. To me, removing that choice is a violation of human rights. In cases where the woman is at risk or the quality of life for the child would be below a respectable means, then yes, if you decide to, abort the fetus. Most abortions are early term (or would be early term if certain factors did not come into the fold), so the part of this argument lodged by many Conservative political and social leaders about the ""frequency of late term abortions"" is inflated and without any concrete facts. But, keep in mind, I'm not saying it NEVER happens, just that the frequency is skewed during debates, especially at Federal and State legislative levels.

I also don't believe that it's murder. The child has not been born, so you can't actually commit murder unless the person being murdered is living. As you can probably deduce from that statement, I don't believe life begins at conception, especially since there is almost no chance a baby can live outside of the womb before the onset of the third trimester. It's a similar stance I have on the right to die. A fetus (pre-third trimester) is completely dependent on the mother for survival, much like Terri Schiavo, for example, was completely dependent on machines for survival.

I think what talking points really matter here is whether it causes suffering to sentient beings and what it contributes to the world. 

So, does it cause suffering? Well, if you listen to the folks who shout that it's murder and then carry on explaining everything in explicit detail, then I guess it does. But, you know, speaking as the guy who brings up '56 billion' on virtually every single topic I visit, I can honestly say that I never have to resort to going too much in detail how animals suffer when I try and make my points and there's no reason for me to accept that these people who utilize appeal to emotion are credible.

Sorry, but if both sides claim something that's factually conflicting, I'm going with the one that doesn't have fundamentalist loonies which have done a lot to destroy their credibility with me.

Now, does abortion contribute anything to the world? Well, this whole notion of 'women being able to do what they want with their body' is a nice little sentiment, but if it causes suffering I honestly don't think someones sense of entitlement permits them to do 'whatever they want' simply because they happen to be a human being. So, if this being were to feel pain, I think we'd need a more legitimate reason.

Oh wait, I got one. Well, I mean, I've got a more legitimate reason than why all of you folks eat your hamburgers and your omelets do anyway -   because abortion is a legitimate means to reduce our massive population of 7.7 billion people.

What makes human life so precious is our self awareness:   the mental capacity to perceive stimuli, organize thoughts about it, communicate how we feel about things, and plan a future for ourselves. It is these very traits which make murder so reprehensible, as murder interrupts these mental aspects of a human being. Murder is wrong because you are ending mental processes which have already had time to develop into a personality. This is not the case for fetuses, as they will not be capable of a comparable degree o mentality until around age 2-3 and even then it will only be in the very beginning stages of development. Saying life begins at conception is ludacris, and merely a technicality; fetuses can't even perceive pain. As a matter of fact, an aborted fetus will never have any idea what happened to it. The fetus will literally experience nothing. It has lived in a vegetative state with no degree of self awareness or self worth (the very things that make murder wrong). Sure, a fetus has the capacity to develop mentally, but just because something has the potential to be just classified the same as me at some point does not mean they are classified the same as me now. A sperm cell has the capacity to become a human, so why wait until conception for it to be deemed sacred?   How is male masturbation different from abortion based on the definitions of humanity provided herein?

One final point, the world is in a state of overpopulation, and this problem is expected to get exponentially worse in our lifetime. If every woman who got pregnant when they weren't prepared to offer a child a respectable growing environment, there would be even more impoverished children leading less than admirable lives and contributing to the over exhaustion of global resources. 

The affirmative stance seems to have an overarching regard for ""life"" as being sacred, to the point where even suggesting the notion of non-
Life as a preferable alternative to certain situations is considered morally reprehensible. In some situations, preventing a child from having a miserable life (be it in a family unfit to raise a child, an orphanage, or some other terrible situation) is better than essentially forcing an individual into a life which no sensible person would choose over simply not existing at all.   If you aren't prepared to give a child the kind of life any human needed to become a functional human being, don't have a child.

Many people are ""Pro-Life,"" but you fail to consider the woman. If the woman is not ready to have a child, she should be able to safely have an abortion done, as opposed to forcing her to do the ""coat-hanger method."" If she is successful with a coat-hanger, there could be serious health issues, including no future pregnancies. Another issue with woman is the woman's body may be physically ready to handle a baby, and abortion is the only way to save the woman's life. As opposed to letting both the woman and the fetus parish, it would be best to save the woman - an already living person - as opposed to killing her.
While both sides have their arguments, I believe that abortion isn't necessarily wrong. I do not believe that the morals of God should prevent anyone from having a choice to abort a fetus. I do not like when people refer to Hitler when referencing abortions, and fetuses are not living until born.","Abortion can change someone's life, but that doesn't make it wrong.",for,"[3, 2, 5]"

I am saying this based on the fact that the relationship between the fetus and mother is entirely giving on the mothers part and taking on the fetuses part. I am saying this based on the definition. If this relationship continued for several years the mother would die.
         Although plenty of women choose to get abortion because of rape, there are other justifiable reasons. A condom can, and may, break. Plenty of human beings have sex for pleasure which is understandable because humans are sexual beings. If a college student practiced this under safe circumstances but was impregnated due to the broken condom can she be blamed for not wanting a baby she hadn't intended on having? 
         The nerves of a baby are not fully developed until roughly 24 weeks, which is about 6 months. This is when the majority of abortions are performed. I also checked with several Perinatology clinics and they all agreed that the fetus is injected with a substance to stop the heart. Even if it could feel pain, it wouldn't be able to now. This is how 98% of abortions are performed. 
         Also, most abortions are performed because the baby isn't going to live very long anyway due to medical complications. Not performing an abortion would actually be murder.
         If you consider a fetus a human, fantastic! However if you complain and say that a woman cannot have an abortion you are breaking the law. The 14th amendment states that no human being has the right to use another humans body or body parts against their will. This includes the fetus. 
         The bible supported abortion done in god's name. If someone feels that the abortion will give them an opportunity to further their faith and connection with God then they have every right to. 
           Also, those who are making the argument for the babies potential, Hitler's mother wanted an abortion, but the doctor talked her out of it.

Men speak about abortion as though it is somebody else's burden- WHICH IT IS. A father should have a say in whether or not he gets to have a baby, but in the end, the mother is the one who will have to go through it. The mother is the one who will deal with the moody, terrible nine months, the hardships of labour, the problems of giving up her life and the MOTHER is the one who should make the decision. An abortion, unless the dad asks for the baby, does not effect the father: the father always has the option to leave, but the mother has to carry the child. Therefore, it should be the mother's decision.
I'm not going to say that having an abortion is an easy decision. If a woman has to get an abortion, then the act of having sex was lead to by a lot of failures. The woman has failed in protecting herself, her parents have failed in teaching her about safe sex, her school has failed in teaching her safety, the church has failed in teaching WHAT THE CHURCH IS ACTUALLY MEANT TO BE TEACHING (do not sleep with someone until marriage), and (if the woman was raped), the man who raped her has failed to follow the law. However, it should be legal.
The woman has clearly made a mistake. We are taught from the moment we start school that life is full of mistakes, and we must learn our lesson and move on from them. If a woman is to make the mistake of having sex before she is ready for a baby, then having to deal with the abortion is going to teach her the lessons. That decision will live with her for the REST OF HER LIFE. It's not easy. But it should be an option.
You say abortion is murder, but how is a woman having to raise a child who can not pay for it, will not care for it, and will have to GIVE UP HER LIFE for it not murdering the woman's life? The child will live an unloving life and will never amount to what (s)he could have if born under different circumstances. 
How about 48 year old woman who are finally winding down and have already dealt with children? They don't want to start over. It's not their fault for having sex with their husband- that's not only legal, but it is morally right and supported by the Bible. That family should have the option of an abortion.
Abortion should be legal. It is NOT YOUR DECISION. If you don't support it, then don't get an abortion. But in the end, it does not effect you unless you are one of the parents. Let people make their own decisions.

The implications of an unwanted child are something that seem just as undesirable at times as the initial abortion. These unwanted children are the people that grow up to become the outcasts of society - being frowned upon, unwanted or raised in a foster home does not provide the same social nourishment as a normal home. Of all arguments against allowing abortion, the bulk of them I see are that it is either: A) against a religious code, or B) murder.

A) As we live in a multicultural world, and in regards that it is near impossible for any religion (if any at all) that we have thought up at any point in time to actually be correct, religious beliefs really have no place in governing the way people make their decisions. If laws are based upon things such as ""the bible says no"", then our western society has now degraded to the same level as the tyrannical theocracies that we so eagerly hate and despise. 

B) The condition of the 'child' at this point is hardly alive. It cannot think, feel, remember, enjoy or experience anything that a born child can. Even legally, this is not murder. Stating that it is murder because 'It will eventually become a child', is essentially the same as stating that someone who has murdered a born human has murdered several hundred people with that one action, because the murdered person would continue on to have a family line.

The decision is solely, of the woman, as she has complete authority over the life she is gestating. Another reason for the legalization of abortion is the future of the child. If prohibited, the child that was born, that would've been aborted, would lead an especially instable life, as the decision to abort must've been made under the consideration of consequences or financial instability. The solution to this dispute of legalization is to educate teens and adults about the process of abortion and the consequences of it, only then can a woman make educated decisions on the topic.

The most common example that comes to mind is the hamster, which depending on the environment at any time, will DEVOUR their offspring.
If we were to define 'wrong' as in 'biologically unnatural', these examples in nature would have proved that abortion is not biologically unnatural, therefore not wrong.

If we were to define wrong as in 'morally incorrect', then morals must be first well established. We all have different morals, and if everybody has the same morals, then such a decision would be unanimous. However, everybody has different morals and values that they place their time in. I think it goes against human rights if you were to impose your own morals against someone else's.
Thirdly, if 'wrong' were to be defined as 'murder', then a different mindset must be taken. In the simplest of senses, an abortion is an act of euthanasia. When it comes to euthanasia, many viewpoints will arise. Definitely, it is a taking of a life. However, if the euthanasia, in this case the abortion, is seen as the best course of action, it should be taken, and no one should be able to stop it. I feel like this completely denounces the argument of how abortion is wrong as long as it is for convenience. Of course euthanasia is for convenience. People euthanize their animals for their convenience, as well as for the animals' convenience.

Of that majority 71.7% are done before the 8 week mark. Also an interesting point, 17.7% of all abortions in 2010 are medical abortions, meaning there was a real and present risk to the mother.

Interestingly enough, the more prevalent sex education and abortions become, we've seen a decline in the number of abortions per year. A 3% decline from 2009, and a 5% decline the year following.

Aside from the facts. There is a poor understanding of when something becomes human. Science cannot give a clear answer, and religion is scattered across the board on the opinion. 

Is it on conception? That doesn't seem to make sense, as millions of sperm and eggs are wasted by bodily functions, or during sex that doesn't lead to pregnancy, either by contraception or simple odds.

Is it when the heart beats? That isn't quite accurate either. We have what we call ""beating heart cadavers"" that aren't considered living.

Brain activity? That's a possibility.

Surviving outside the womb, or independent of the ""life support"" of the mother? Another answer that's possible.

The concept of bodily integrity is an important factor coming into play. Did you know that a deceased person cannot have their organs harvested unless they previously gave permission? With this mindset being so vital, the concept of medical abortions are the same. One cannot be expected to choose another's life over the right to personal autonomy, unless they explicitly agree otherwise.

Heralding abortion as a ""human right"" is, in my opinion, delusional and devolves cultures. This ultimately leads to the idea that abortion isn't a bad thing. Actually we very commonly see American liberals portraying abortion as a good thing (in parallel with their argument that abortion is a human right). This attitude that abortion should be readily available to anyone who wants one is devolving our younger generations culturally, socially, and sexually. At the end of the day the vast majority of unwanted pregnancies occur because of extreme carelessness. There are many current methods which should prevent unwanted pregnancy for just about any responsible person (birth control pill, condoms, IUD, plan B pill)

On the other hand, there are societal issues that would occur if we banned abortion. The conservative idea that all abortion should be illegal is not right either. In cases of rape, it should obviously be an option. Also, we would see an influx in birthrates across the board, especially in low-income areas where children are less supported. 

The issues of rape and birthrate influxes in low-income areas are the two topics that need to be discussed before regulating abortion. At the face of it, abortion should not be illegal. We need to address the topics of rape and birthrate influx in low-income areas. We need to stop this almost celebration of abortion.

In a perfect world, the need for it would, hopefully, be non-existent. Unfortunately, opinions on the matter sway to either two extremes, without seeing the middle ground in the motivations, and need, for contraceptives and other forms of birth control.

Regardless of what one does, a life will be lost. When women don’t have access to family planning, this encourages them to take risks with their own personal health, and many die in the process. And on the other hand, pregnancy is not always a gift, a child is not always conceived in beneficial circumstances, nature makes a joke out of a fetus, and women are faced with the difficult choice of carrying a child to term who they may not be able to care for adequately. Amongst a variety of reasons why she might decide to terminate her pregnancy.

I would hope someday, abortion would be a last resort, emergency option. If people feel morally obliged to protect the potential of unborn children, measures must be taken to ensure, on some level, these children will be loved and cared for. Not every woman is a mother, and we shouldn’t demand, as a society, that the singular duty of an individual who happens to possess a uterus conceive a child.

And yet, it takes two to tango, so the male equation in the role of creating a child can not be overlooked. I find often that the guilt and shame of difficult pregnancies are still blamed on the woman. Unless there’s some form of artificial insemination going on here, why are women the scapegoats for religious or moral objections to abortion? Was it really even her choice? Was there something going on much deeper that we are ignoring? 

At the end of the day, no one, besides the parent(s), and those trained to perform abortion, should have any say in a person’s decision to end their pregnancy. There are many things happening in the world which we may or may not agree with. However, we should have people’s best interests at heart. Prohibiting and outlawing abortion does not but give a veneer that it no longer exists.

However, I see abortion as acceptable because I believe it is a logically right choice. Just as you would implement a pre-marital sex scenario to prove it is wrong, I can also create a scenario where it is viewed as a better alternative.



What if, and take in mind this is another possible scenario, your sister on her second trimester, suffers an infection which may threaten both her and the child's life? The baby's shape and form can be seen, but the infection puts them at heavy risk if given the time to mutate and regenerate.



Will you bear to put her at the risk of dying with the child? A person whom you have known for as long as you could remember, dying meaninglessly because of an infection and an obstinate attitude of keeping a child that will take her life?



I wouldn't. Instead of gambling both mother and child at a high risk, I would very much rather my sister abort the child to attempt pregnancy again at low risk.



As a process to increase the survival of one instead of ending both lives, I would go for it. I agree to abortion.



Some would start bringing in topics like ""Taking a life is wrong, you shouldn't kill the baby even if the mother would die if left unchecked because that would be for your own convenience. It MUST come into this world"" I won't argue, that is an opinion they are entitled to, as specious as it may seem.



If I may create a simpler way of understanding, I would like to think of abortion as a tool, like a saw. A saw is meant to be used to saw through wood. But, even if it is silly or looked down upon, if paper is aligned properly and has both ends pressed down, the saw can also be used to cut, or tear paper. (if the saw is blunt / not aligned properly, or if the paper's thick enough etc.)



Some would think abortion to save one life out of two is a good idea, because of personal and logical reasons alike. In this case, you're using abortion as a tool that is appropriate for the situation. (Saw sawing through wood) However, some others choose the 'result' from abortion, ""one life of the two is killed"", as an ideal, which results in them going through abortion themselves to remove the life within them. (Saw cutting / tearing paper.)



The question itself is misleading. ""Is abortion wrong?"" As a concept, no, it is acceptable. As a process, no, because it is essentially killing one life to save another. But people are wrong. People like to reverse-engineer solutions, results, causes, and the like.



People misuse this result of ""one life is killed"" for their own benefit, their own convenience and so they go for abortion, even when they don't really need it. That is why people who are against these abusers of this simplistic process are against abortion under those circumstances.



I just hope you people here aren't the type to stereotype a specific scenario, a certain situation, and derive all sorts of arguments from their own, and only one single point of view.



All in all, abortion as a concept, is perfectly acceptable. It's simple math and anyone would want to salvage from this tricky situation as much as they can - Trading one life for two is better than losing two lives.

Letting someone having an abortion in the case of rape, incest or the person carrying it is in mortal danger (shame on you, Ireland) is really a no-brainer; it's basic common sense.

Well, if a fetus is a human being, how come the census doesn't count them? If a fetus is a human being, how come when there’s a miscarriage they don’t have a funeral? If a fetus is a human being, how come people say “we have two children and one on the way” instead of saying “we have three children?” People say life begins at conception, I say life began about a billion years ago and it’s a continuous process.

The really hardcore people will tell you life begins at fertilization. Fertilization, when the sperm fertilizes the egg. But even after the egg is fertilized, it’s still six or seven days before it reaches the uterus and pregnancy begins, and not every egg makes it that far. Eighty percent of a woman’s fertilized eggs are rinsed and flushed out of her body once a month during those delightful few days she has. They wind up on sanitary napkins, and yet they are fertilized eggs. So basically what these anti-abortion people are telling us is that any woman who’s had more than more than one period is a serial killer! Consistency. Consistency.

And the ""sanctity of life""? I mean, even if there were such a thing, I don’t think it’s something you can blame on God. No, you know where the sanctity of life came from? We made it up. You know why? ‘Cuz we’re alive. Self-interest. Living people have a strong interest in promoting the idea that somehow life is sacred. You don’t see Abbott and Costello running around, talking about this, do you? We’re not hearing a whole lot from Mussolini on the subject. What’s the latest from JFK? Not a thing. ‘Cuz JFK, Mussolini and Abbott and Costello are dead. They’re DEAD. And dead people give less than a $h!T about the sanctity of life. Only living people care about it so the whole thing grows out of a completely biased point of view. It’s a self serving, man-made bull$h!T story.

Even with all this stuff we preach about the sanctity of life, we don’t practice it. We don’t practice it. Look at what we’d kill: Mosquitoes and flies. ‘Cuz they’re pests. Lions and tigers. ‘Cuz it’s fun! Chickens and pigs. ‘Cuz we’re hungry.

And you might have noticed something else. The sanctity of life doesn’t seem to apply to cancer cells, does it? You rarely see a bumper sticker that says “Save the tumors.”. Or “I brake for advanced melanoma.”. No, viruses, mold, mildew, maggots, fungus, weeds, E. Coli bacteria, the crabs. Nothing sacred about those things.

If the circumstances do not apply, then it should not be neglected, but looked into. If the woman is truly desperate not to have a child she will resort to dangerous ways of removing the fetus.
A lot of people consider it murder, yet a fetus is not a human. A fetus differs from a baby. It is a developing form of life, but it is entirely dependent on the mother's body, therefore indicating that it is NOT an individual, and any choices made will affect both the mother and the fetus.
Back to my main point, the fetus cannot make it's own decisions, and the mother- the host, has a right to her own body to decide what she wants to do.

That is to say- they typically have a reason for asking for such a procedure to be exercised. Children born into an environment where they're unwanted- whether it be because they cannot be provided for or they are a detriment to their mother or father's future plans- will often not receive proper parenting, and in the case of a large number of people seeking abortions- be born into an adverse environment. Sub-par parenting and harsh conditions lead children to become more likely to become criminals (https://www.Ncjrs.Gov/html/ojjdp/jjjournal_2003_2/page3.Html for those of you who think I'm pulling this out of my rear end).
Furthermore, forced living leaves the child burdened with the ubquitous sufferings of humanity without the comfort and joy of a mother or father that loves him. This leads to the question of whether all life is sacred, and if having a life at all is ""better"" than not. Now there is no statement of absolute morality which claims that life is sacred save religious scriptures. However, even disregarding the Free Exercise Clause and the separation of church and state, religious scriptures cannot be used as a rational basis for any argument contending that life is sacred, simply for the fact that religion is based on faith. Faith is, by definition, a belief that arises without logical reasoning. Therefore, any person who makes a claim that whatever religion they practice holds all life to be sacred, and as a result of that perceived ""sacredness"" finds abortion to be an abomination is committing the logical fallacy of ""begging the question""- making the unproven assumption that something is true.
Finally, I'd like to redirect this entire contention back to the main idea. ""Is abortion wrong?"" The term ""wrong"" itself implies the implementation of moral philosophy, but there are different ""types"" of morality. However, the form of morality most consistent with reality is consequentialism- where the ends justify the means. The argument from the Pro side (""Pro"" as it applies to debate) is that abortion ends a life. That certainly is bad, but from a moral perspective, that's not always ""wrong"". What would be wrong would be to insist that a woman give birth to a child that she doesn't want in the first place, condemning that child to a future without the exhilaration and comfort of being loved from the very beginning.

2077,2077,1582735052-2388,https://www.debate.org/opinions/is-abortion-wrong,"Let me begin my argument with this, I am going to operate under the assumption that those who oppose my argument believe every life is equal, and that life begins at the moment of conception. 

The first problem is that with this argument there can be absolutely no termination of any pregnancy under any situation. For example, a victim impregnated by rape. This could mean that the victim is underage, was also abused, and even that the fetus they are carrying is the product of an incestous crime. 

According to (http://www.Nsvrc.Org/sites/default/files/publications_nsvrc_factsheet_media-packet_statistics-about-sexual-violence_0.Pdf)
One in five women will be raped in their lifetime, and the majority of these rapes will go unreported. In the situation of rape, women can find themselves pregnant based on no fault or wrongdoing of their own. If abortion is made illegal they will find themselves saddled with a long hard pregnancy, a birth, and either a child or adoption. Not only can the pregnancy be traumatizing as these women have to grow and carry around a fetus that is half the man who violently attacked them, but giving birth is 14 times more likely to cause a death than an abortion. Also, according to (http://www.Webmd.Com/baby/features/cost-of-having-a-baby), an uncomplicated vaginal birth costs $9,600, an uncomplicated cesarean birth is $15,800, and prenatal care is $2,000. That could be up to nearly $18,000 in costs not counting baby supplies. 

If a person is truly pro-life they cannot allow for women who have been raped to receive abortions. This is because if all lives are equal and start at conception then a life created through rape or through consentual intercourse are equal and no exceptions can be made. If a rape victim was allowed to abort her fetus, but another woman was not allowed to abort hers and it was created through consensual sex then the fetuses lives were never equal. 

The same logic applies to women who have late-term complications in their pregnancies. Even if a woman truly wanted children, there can be situations where they need abortions to protect their own lives. For example, picture a seven month pregnant woman who just found out that her child has a terminal illness, and by allowing it to stay inside her uterus, she puts herself at risk. In this situation removing the fetus, even though it would never be able to live outside the womb, would be considered an abortion. Pro-life individuals would have to put the fetal life at the same value as the life of the mother, and since the fetus cannot speak for itself, it cannot forfeit its right to life. This would lead to a woman dying for a child that could live maybe twenty minutes. 

Women also should have the right to bodily autonomy. Essentially, what a woman does with her body is her choice and she can do as she sees fit. If she doesn't want to dye her hair blue she doesn't have to, if she doesn't want an abortion she doesn't have to.",Women Deserve Bodily Autonomy,for,"[6, 8, 2]"

I respect other people's opinions, but in return I ask you respect mine:

I am not religious, but if I assume God is real, and abortion is a sin, Jesus also said to ""love thy neighbor"" and that we're all sinners, so even if it is viewed as a sin, and no one should be proud to have it done, but having it be a sin is not a good reason to stop it.

I also believe murder is wrong, and that the right to life is important, but this goes both ways:
The baby
The mother

If the mother was raped and is completely unready to have a child (let's say she's a junior in high school) and she has her entire future planned out, if she has this baby that she was careful to avoid having in the first place, but did not have a choice to avoid (rape), the labor could kill her even if sge decides to put it up for adoption. Also, people don't realize how sick pregnancy can make people. I only see it as murder if the two consenting people were careless. If the two people have carefully thought it through, considered all the other options, and risks, it is not murder. On top of that, the definition of murder (in noun form) is ""the unlawful premeditated killing of one human being by another"", so in order for it to be murder, it would have to be illegal, so, perhaps, in some places it is, and in others it isn't.

Now for it to be ""damaging to women"". Any surgery is damaging, no matter what your sex. I realize they don't justmean physically, but any medical procedure that is, or is similar to surgery or abortion carries it's other risks, possible death, emotional stress, and, of course, physical effects, so are you saying to ban all risky medical procedures ever?

With all that said, I do think abortion is neither right nor wrong, but dependant on the situation. If the person getting the abortion is under 17, they should have a parent (or judge's) consent, and the doctor doing the abortion should inform the mother (and presumed father) make the procedure itself as humane as we can (with our current knowledge) for the baby.","It's not perfect, but...",for,"[2, 6]"

All cases involving rape victims and overall health of the woman and the offspring shouldn't even be subject to debate. Pro-life and religious fanatics don't seem to care about these matters, they just want more children because they 'belong to god and we need more church members'.

In cases where health matters are not a concern, there needs to be at least some formal processes that evaluate the woman's reasons, and it should at least be consensual between both parents (that is, assuming the father did not just walk off and wants nothing to do with the woman). I cannot rationalize it when both parents are on opposite ends of the spectrum, and a decision is made against the other parent's will (they both bear the responsibility in my opinion). 

As for cases where they're not ready for this (assuming no health concerns or conflicts among the parents decision exists), life is full of things that we did not want or did not want it now, but often times we have to step up and deal with it.

It makes no sense to say that a fetus magically gains personhood as it passes through its moms birth canal, but it also makes no sense to say that a freshly formed zygote is a human being. So really, there are any number of arguments as to when the precise moment a fetus becomes human, none of which have any solid backing. One could say it's the moment its heart starts beating, but a beating heart alone doesn't characterize a person, nor does two conjoined pairs of chromosomes on their own. This is a deep philosophical question that transcends science and may never have a definite answer, so it is pointless to ask when action must be taken.

Perception and personal opinions often fly high in an attempt to discredit or challenge the views held by the opposing ends. Moreover, the views presented by the proponent and opponents of abortion in debates sometimes stem in part from personal opinions rather than relying on facts.

In support of the pro-life proponents, one may say that abortion exposes people to adverse psychological and health effects, and that is because women who procure abortions are more likely to suffer from suicidal ideation, major depressions, and anxiety disorders. The risk factor for these health conditions has been determined to be significantly high among women who procure abortions as opposed to their counterparts who have never conceived. Similarly, the risk factors have been established to be lower among women who carry their pregnancies to terms.

In contrast, the pro-choice proponents argue that along with the fundamental right of a personal choice, legalizing abortion has direct impacts on crime reduction, particularly in the United States. Some Statistics show that since the 1970s, legalizing abortion in certain states significantly reduced the crime, especially among teenagers who are most likely to give birth to children who may become criminals, or engage in illegal activities. Moreover, if there is access to legal abortion, women would have control over the timing of their pregnancy and therefore will be less likely to seek the path for illegal abortion, which is a criminal offense.   

It is hard to stand a middle ground when it comes to such a debatable topic or abortion. While some women use economic reasons as an excuse to procure abortion, other women really need to make this choice as their health may be in danger, or they can be victims of rape or incest. Regardless of the standpoint here, there are some indisputable facts. If abortion is not legal, it will inevitably result in illegal abortions performed by the so-called ""back-alley"" abortionists in settings with a high risk of maternal injury and even death.

A fetus does not have completely developed organs, feelings, or thoughts as a living BABY has. An embryo or a fetus is not a person, therefore, it is not murder. There's no way they can have more importance than women. Women can think, feel and make their own decisions. How would I feel if I were an aborted fetus? Answer: Nothing. I wouldn't feel anything. Why? I can't think. Do you have any memories of when you were in the womb? I think not. Adoption is still an available choice. A woman has the right to choose. Let us not go back to dark times where women died with their fetuses by having back alley abortions. It is a very difficult choice that, hopefully, is NEVER taken lightly, but women who have had a abortion should not be shamed. Women AND their partners have the right to know about all of the options that they have. Birth control is only 99% effective. Abstinence is a good idea in itself, but NO human being is perfect. If you think you're above someone because you are a virgin and they are not, you need to get a reality check. However, on this topic, I do stand on the middle ground.

I cannot emphasize the word POTENTIAL enough. To the people who oppose me; I do understand where you are coming from. I can see where you start to think of abortion as murder. It definitely makes you see a person in a different light when you learn they have had an abortion. But do you really want a mother on welfare with seven children? Do you want to add to our already massive population? Do you want your taxes to go to all of these poor, eventually ""worthless"" citizens? Does it devastate a community and put people into fear of a serial killer (no, so is it really ""murder"")? I do know people who have had abortions. Yes, it haunts them, but bad choices haunt everyone. I think that women who have had abortions should get the support they need instead of condemning them. So, then, maybe suicide wouldn't be such a prominent result. Before you use that argument (""It makes women suffer""), think about what anti-choice protestors DO to those women!

I have no doubt that at this very moment women all around the world are making the extremely tough decision of having an abortion. Supposedly ""ending"" a life. But how can something that hasn't been born die? Birth is dated from the minute the child is BORN, not conceited.

I believe that women should have a choice. Not only because it's their body, but also because the upbringing of a child is not just an easy 9 month long period with a extremely painful labour, but also every moment after birth. The mothers life does not only belong to them anymore, they have someone else to look after as well as themselves.

You might be thinking ""well if they are not in the possession of money and can't handle a child they should stop sleeping around"" and yes. You would be right.

Although this topic is controversial, I would like to say abortion is not something most women take lightly. It's not as simple as a few people might think. Women don't just walk into abortion clinics and go ""there's a fetus inside me, let's kill it because I don't feel like one right now"" 

Have any of you ever had that perfect image of how your life would be in the future? Perhaps a beautiful house on the outskirts of the city, a big backyard lush with freshly mowed grass courtesy of your partner, your child playing happily with endless glee.

Is it not possible a women would Rather want this kind of lifestyle (or something in their own perspective) for their child? Is it not possible that it's not just a ""selfish decision "" but a reasonable one that should not be judged? Is it possible that a women could   willingly 'murder' the growing in her body without a second thought? 

I'm not saying it isn't possible, but im trying to show people that... Maybe,   a women is capable of making the decision on wether she can take care and nurture a child after birth, and if she can't she should be able to abort without being judged on her decision. 

A women could be in one of many circumstances where she just can't have a kid. Isnt forcing her into having a child she knows she cannot   provide the needs for   just as bad as the termination?",Abortion is not simply wrong,for,[2]

However if you ask what should happen to the humans that fight for their religious beliefs across the globe they would say bomb 'em.   So if we are to use the preposition that if a human is doing harm to you be it emotionally (terrorism) or physically than we have the right to protect ourselves from that human.   By the argument given by the pro-lifers is then that an unborn child is a human does the mother not have the same rights to protect themselves from emotional or physical damage.   What they really want to say is the everyone should pay for their bad choices and suffer.   So if a teenager gets pregnant the only way to teach her not to do it again is to force her through a process her emotional development has not prepared her for.

Such common manner of viewing this argument (where ending a life is murder, and thus illegal) though is simply twisting our morality to fit our views. Perhaps you've 'murdered' a child, but did it really have a real life? It never really did live. Ending it is but never letting it live. Is that so bad?

A very common answer is a person's high sentience, or the ability to perceive. The inherent morality of aborting a fetus or embryo therefore comes from it's ability to perceive. This trait is extremely likely to come from the brain, as it is a human's vessel of thought. In early stages of development (before the brain has developed), abortion is not really murder, as there is likely no sentient person on the receiving end of the action.

An argument cannot be made to compromise a woman's freedom for something that isn't even able to think, even if it is technically a human. It is morally worse to kill an animal for meat than to abort an embryo in its early stages, as it probably perceives more than the embryo.

3. Abortion isn't murder. If it is, meat is murder and hunters are murderers. Murder is death with malice intent. Nobody goes around having babies just to kill them.

4. The baby feels pain. After 8 weeks, the baby develops nerve cells. But we don't know if it feels pain. No one knows. Probably, no one will ever know. And if it does feel pain, animals feel pain too don't they? Why aren't we catering to them?

5. God, oh how you have confused these little people's minds. A lot of people believe that abortion is a disgrace to God. Those same people probably believe that God makes all the decisions. So if a woman wants an abortion, its God's decision, right? Apparently so.

It would prevent you from having a child. Sperm is one half of a fetus (which develops and turns into a child) and in a developing, already born child I'm sure that if you took half of them away that they'd die. If we go to include abortion into the category of murder then we should include all kinds of actions that prevent births as murder. Is not having a child murder? Your sperm dies eventually and therefore a child will not be able to be born if you don't have sex and use the sperm to fertilize the egg. Not having a child could be compared to having the choice to save a person hanging off a cliff: you could save them, but you're not sure as it's a lot of work. Would not helping someone in a situation in which they could lose their life count as murder? It sounds simple, just save them, but if you had a burden to prevent you and saving their life would take a lot of time and give you a lot of pain then would you still count it as murder if you did not save them? Yes it is a fetus, but it is not capable of thought and most likely wouldn't feel pain until late in its development.
People say that killing a fetus is murder because you are killing it and it is human. When, what will become a child/fetus, starts its development it is originally one cell (and then it divides and grows and does unimportant stuff) and if we count the destruction of one cell as murder then we are murdering something every time we give high-fives.
Lastly, the child is going to die anyway (even if she/he lives to be 100) and making their life miserable by making them conceived by people that don't want them is also immoral.

The problem lies here: at the overpopulation of the world, the stability of a fetus's nervous system, and the conditions for the abortion. 

There is no doubt that the earth is becoming overpopulated. The need for resources increase every year. It has been proven that soon we will have more people than we have food to support those people. Abortion is a way to help with this issue by preventing unwanted babies from delivery, and in turn, causing a colossal crisis in the form of lack of resources, and possibly ending millions, if not billions of lives through starvation. There are other ways to solve this such as a one or two-child law, but the point is that according to the majority of people, the extinction of mankind would be more devastating than the extinction of 23.2% of fetuses.

Pro-life followers tend to suggest that fetuses can feel pain and therefore, abortion is murder. But this is not entirely true. The nervous system is not fully developed enough to detect pain until a bit after 20 weeks following conception. The system CAN detect reflexes due to non-painful stimuli, but the fact is that a fetus does not have the proper thalamocortical connections to be aware of these stimuli until 23 to 30 weeks of gestation. And even when aware of this pain without feeling it directly, electroencephalography suggests the capacity for functional pain perception in preterm neonates probably does not exist before 29 or 30 weeks. And since only about 1.4% of abortions occur after 21 weeks of gestation, this is good news, as most will not feel the abortion. To solve this problem securely, abortions should only be allowed 20 weeks or before, in order to prevent the consciousness of pain, and most of them have these rules but this cannot account for abortions outside of hospitals. Beyond the 20 week mark, it should be considered immoral, but not before.

And finally, the conditions of the abortion matter immensely. Most importantly the financial situation or the possibility of rape. Any moral person should know that considering the facts above, it would be borderline malicious to bring any human into this world that cannot be properly supported. This includes impoverished families. Abortion is less cruel than the prolonged suffering of poverty and the squalid living conditions of a hovel. Adoption could possibly be a last resort, but should only be to families following a such one or two-child law, or at least has at the most one child, in order to lessen overpopulation. Rape, on the other hand, should never be ignored and have us force a raped woman to have the baby. And yes, women can get pregnant from rape. That has been proven since the invention of war. 

Concluding, abortion is acceptable on certain grounds.

My argument is mainly aimed at you as I am absolutely horrified by your statement, not to mention your reference to a 2 year old child being the same as a foetus. A foetus and a 2 year old have completely different abilities and a completely different brain capacity(being that a foetus has none). Can a foetus hold your hand? Can a foetus say I love you? NO. Therefore the fact that you even attempted to compare the two is ridiculous. Now, I am completely aware that there is a point whilst a foetus is developing that they transition from a foetus to a baby, however providing the abortion is before this time there is no reason to suggest the foetus to be considered a baby. 

""That baby was human at the time of birth, which means that it must have been human 5 minutes before the birth. So if the baby is a human before birth, then that means that it is a human while it is a fetus."" < this is a quote from you appalling statement and I think it might have been this part that shocked me the most. Granted a baby is a human 5 minutes before birth, however what about 7 months before this birth was it still a human then? When it did not even have fingers or toes? The answer is NO, it was not , it was just a bunch of cells, no thoughts, no feelings, just cells. A 2 year old on the other hand is a life. It has emotions, a heart, a pulse, a brain, it feels things that a foetus under the age of LEGAL abortion could never feel. Want to know why? BECAUSE IT IS WITHOUT A BRAIN AT THIS STAGE! 

And by the way you snuck in a snide comment about adoption always being another option, but I would like for you to imagine you carrying something for 9 month. You going through all the ups and downs a pregnancy can have, then after going through God knows how many hours of excruciating labour, you holding this tiny, defenceless, innocent baby in your arms and starring into its youthful eyes and feeling that bond and connection that you pray will never be broken. But wait there's an interruption at the door, oh that's right it's the parents you signed your baby off to 7 months ago when it was a still a foetus! What a shame!

I really hope that I have made my point extremely clear and just in case you still don't get it - FOETUS IS DIFFERENT TO BABY, BABY IS DIFFERENT TO 2 YEAR OLD AND FETUS IS DIFFERENT TO 2 YEAR OLD!","Abortion=murdering 2 year olds"" what a joker!!!",for,[3]

This is not enough to qualify as 'human life', as individuals with only lower brain functioning are legally considered to be brain dead, and therefore actually dead for all intents and purposes besides organ donation.

Conservatives and Republicans HATE big government intrusion, yet with this issue, its free range to intrude into people's lives.
Abortion is a right, and the law of the land. We should come to a compromise about this issue. This issue, like most, is not black and white, 100% right or wrong each way. Here is what I suggest:
1. Abortions should be rare, but ultimately the choice of the woman.
2. A cut off date between 20-24 weeks, there after you cannot legally get an abortion.
3. Exception: rape and incest cases should allow the woman to have an abortion anytime.
3. Do not shut down nearly every women's clinic is a state. Women who seek this help should be able to. Otherwise they may go to extreme/dangerous means to have the abortion.
4. Offer preventative care. Condoms, birth control, sex education, FACTUAL abortion information.

First, murder is the intentional killing of a person. From the Oxford English dictionary, murder is ""the unlawful premeditated killing of one human being by another."" The distinction of human being is important, because it is what distinguishes murder from killing. A person may swat a fly without a second thought, but the killing of another person is abhorrent. Similarly, a person may hunt animals and wild game, yet they would not shoot a person.

What makes murder wrong is that is is the killing of a being that is aware, sentient, and intelligent. Killing a being that is aware of its own existence and mortality is a cruelty that goes unmatched. It is the being's sentience that defines the cruelty, however. A fly or other simple animal has no sentience to speak of, and therefore is not hurt or traumatized through nonexistence.

The fetus in the first trimester is not aware nor does it even have the capabilities of awareness or feeling. How then can abortion be cruel if a fetus cannot possibly be aware of it? By definition, if a fetus is unaware of abortion, then it cannot be cruel. Though the fetus may be alive and human, it is not a person anymore than the cells in my arm are a person.

If this relationship continued for several years the mother would die.
         Although plenty of women choose to get abortion because of rape, there are other justifiable reasons. A condom can, and may, break. Plenty of human beings have sex for pleasure which is understandable because humans are sexual beings. If a college student practiced this under safe circumstances but was impregnated due to the broken condom can she be blamed for not wanting a baby she hadn't intended on having? 
         The nerves of a baby are not fully developed until roughly 24 weeks, which is about 6 months. This is when the majority of abortions are performed. I also checked with several Perinatology clinics and they all agreed that the fetus is injected with a substance to stop the heart. Even if it could feel pain, it wouldn't be able to now. This is how 98% of abortions are performed. 
         Also, most abortions are performed because the baby isn't going to live very long anyway due to medical complications. Not performing an abortion would actually be murder.
         If you consider a fetus a human, fantastic! However if you complain and say that a woman cannot have an abortion you are breaking the law. The 14th amendment states that no human being has the right to use another humans body or body parts against their will. This includes the fetus.

Most women don't want to get abortions; it's emotionally damaging and traumatic. But so is being pregnant with a baby you know you can't care for. Knowing that the fetus in your womb will likely suffer all their life. The fetus may be alive, But it doesn't have a life. The woman has one that you are forcing her to give up.

Ignoring basic human rights to ones own body, lets talk economy. Fact, when women are not suppressed an economy does better. Women whom are allowed to control their own body can go to school, choose a career, contribute to society in monetary ways. A woman who has a baby and is not ready for it, can potentially drop out of school (or never even attend), lose jobs, only work part time, and will be a drain on society. She'll more likely need food stamps, WIC, and other programs. Allowing women the chance to control their future, will help with this drain.

Also, most women who want an abortion don't do it callously. They may feel it's a life, but it's the best choice for them. A lot of women want something better for themselves. Allowing women to control their bodies, lowers crimes over time. 

On top of these reasons, making abortions illegal has NEVER worked. It has always caused more harm than good. Women will find ways to get rid of their unwanted child. Back Alley abortions will happen, now risking the life of the mother as well. Dumpster babies may even become more common as they were in the past. By regulating abortions we can help women rid themselves of a dangerous or unwanted pregnancy in a safe way that also can place boundaries on the termination of the pregnancy. (Such as not terminating after the fetus can actually feel pain and actually has brain activity). 

In addition, there are MANY reasons to get an abortion. Sometimes it is a young scared girl that ""messed up."" Sometimes it's society pressure. A lot of the time the mothers life is at risk,or the mother was raped. Also, some women do go for adoption, but many children are not adopted or will enter ""the system"" and be raised in foster care. Some of the willing adopters are even having hard times because of state laws.

That is the most ridiculous argument possible. NOBODY cares about your body okay? People care about the CHILD yes CHILD inside your body. Nobody cares about your gallbladder, tonsils, teeth or kidneys. They care about the child inside you. How hard is it to understand that?   If there is no person inside there, then what is it? Where did you come from? Outer space? People also love to argue that it is ""just a bundle of cells."" That means you are just a bundle of cells, life has no meaning, and there is no such thing as human life. Murder should be legal by that argument. 


Also, the same argument for abortion is the same argument for slavery. You do not get to define what a human being is by whether or not it is inconvenient to you. I can argue that my slave has no rights because he is on my property, and he has no life because he is my slave. He only exists by my use for him. Therefore you can't tell me what to do with him. < That is the actual logic pro-choice people use. If you think your convenience is more important than a human life, then that makes you an actual evil person. The Jews were undesirable to Hitler, so he killed 5 million of them. 

Also it is not a religious thing at all. It is a human life thing. Without morals, without sense of being human, we would have no society, only chaos. Life is sacred. Children are a gift, not a curse. 

I also love how the same liberals claiming to fight for the rights of minorities support abortion. Approximately 70% of abortions are performed on black or Hispanic women. Liberals don't care about minorities rights, or even ""women's rights"" as they claim to, they only use them to further their agenda and their world image.   The overwhelming amount of abortions are also for convenience issues. Only a very small percentage are for actual health-risks or rape cases. Many abortions also occur when the baby can be born prematurely and still live a healthy life.

The answer to abortion is to be more responsible and use that thing called a brain (which a fetus posses by the way) to make smarter decisions regarding sex. Use condoms, contraceptives, emergency pill, etc. There are SO many things you can use these days. This is not the year 1400. With everything out there today, there should be NO reason why anyone should be getting pregnant ""against their will."" If you had unsafe sex, then I'm sorry but it is your fault.

Many people say it is just a moral thing that you come up on your own but, life is actually the FIRST unalienable right in the Constitution, “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are LIFE, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” It’s right there! IT IS THE FIRST unalienable right, the first one! Many people would argue that, when a baby is conceived, it is not actually alive, and that it is just a mass of cells. WELL THEY’RE WRONG!!! If a woman isn’t pregnant with a baby for those 9 MONTHS, what is he pregnant with? It has been scientifically proven that life begins at the same time as the child is conceived. AT THE SAME TIME! Dr. Alfred M. Bongioanni stated, “I have learned from my earliest medical education that human life begins at the time of conception…. I submit that human life is present throughout this entire sequence from conception to adulthood.” There are also sonograms. The pictures taken inside a mother’s womb that shows a LIVING, GROWING baby! Abortion is a direct violation of the right to life.
		The 14th amendment states that all American citizens have the same protected rights, and life is one of those rights. In fact it states, “….Nor shall any state deprive any person of life [or] liberty”. It states right off the bat in the first section that no state and to extension that no person can deprive anyone of the right to life, babies are humans too! Not to mention, anyone who has a person who is an American citizen is also an American citizen. They become American citizens, therefore their right to MUST be protected IMMEDIATELY. Therefore, abortion is a DIRECT violation of their right to life! This right MUST be protected, as the 14th amendment also states that it protects the right to life. ABORTION IS A DIRECT VIOLATION OF AN INFANT’S RIGHT TO LIFE!
	The American government must protect the unborn baby’s rights, and they are doing a really bad at their job. Granted, more pro-life people are coming to power, but that doesn't change the fact that it’s STILL LEGAL. Here’s a fact, ever since Roe v.

2533,2533,1580225173-162,https://www.debate.org/opinions/do-women-have-the-right-to-abortion,"In Canada, a fetus has no rights until it's born. It's viewed as a blob of cells until it evacuates the womb. However, once a fetus is born it's considered a baby and immediately it's murder to kill the same fetus that was in the womb only seconds earlier. This baby now has human rights, but why not sooner?
According to many feminists and like-minded people, this is because the fetus is within the mother's body and therefore, the mother has the power to choose abortion. 
I am going to refer to the process of land-owning to paint a small picture for a moment. A landowner has the ability to sell and modify his land. However, a landowner can only modify his land according to regulations and laws. These laws ensure that wildlife and natural resources aren't harmed. Although the landowner has power over the land itself, he does not have unlimited abilities within his power to do what he wants with the land.   
Now, retain that image as we survey abortion. A mother also has the ability to sell her body (prostitution: as of 2014 it is illegal to buy prostitution, not sell it) and modify it through tattoos, piercings, etc. 
However, our government regulates drug use, the selling of your own organs, and assisted suicide because they are dangerous to yourself and society. So clearly, we do not maintain full control over our own bodies. 
If an action limits or defiles another person's rights, then we lose the ability to do what we please with our bodies. 
Now, many feminists will state that a fetus does not qualify as ""another person"" because it's not ""living."". However, when we talk about creation theories, we consider the single-celled organisms of Archaea to be the first ""living thing."" So why are the first existent cells on Earth considered to be 'life' but a fetus is not yet 'living?'
Now, some people may also argue that a fetus is alive but it cannot sustain itself and therefore, the mother has the right to abortion. But suppose a woman decides that doesn't want her baby after it's born and lets it die. Would this be considered murder or would this still remain part of her rights? Obviously this woman would be tried for murder because she refused to care for the baby even though it's completely dependent on her for survival. 
A fetus is also completely dependent on it's mother for survival not because it's any less of a human being but because it's not fully developed and cannot function on its own. (The same could be said for many disabled children and newborn babies.)
I am not one of those people who is heartless to cases of rape, a woman's financial status, or lack of support etc. Rather, I sympathize   with everyone that finds themselves in these cases and I cannot imagine how hard it would be to go through that.

becoming so engrossed in their emotions, feelings, and illogical ideas of what morality is. Use logic. The arguments I have seen include the following: the child (excellent vocabulary choice to increase the emotional weight on the fragile but illogical human conscience, but the correct term is fetus) is murder in an abortion and science says that it is very painful. Really? I remember my pain, thoughts, feelings, all so vividly as I rested peacefully in the dark...Is something that nobody could ever say. 

If I were aborted, it would have been as if I had never been conceived in the first place. I never would have known of my existence to begin with. The next argument is, the ""child"" should get their chance to live life. Really? I feel so horribly bad for the millions of other sperm which were too slow to reach the egg on time. All those other sperm (or should I say children) would have done the same thing as the one single sperm that did make it into the stage of being a fetus. Yet, had any of those other millions of sperm made it, an entirely different child would be born to frolic in the world and what not.

If anything, by not using logic and reasoning, you have developed a toxic ideology. Now, one baby will be doomed to live a life worse than that of the other baby which said mother will now refrain from having as her hands are now full with the first child. By aborting the child you are simply ensuring that A CHILD will eventually get born in the best conditions possible. I beg you to look at the big picture of what life actually is.

I agree, abortion is murder, but murder is not always bad. Let's think, why is murder bad? Here are the Four Reasons. 

1. Murder is bad because the victim will feel the immediate pain of dying, which they are capable of feeling, and it is against their will to feel this. 

2. Murder is bad because the victim is aware that they are alive, and they have a will to remain alive, thus it is against their will to be taken out of life. 

3. Murder is bad because other people have a will to keep said victim alive, and thus it is against their will that the victim be killed.

4. Murder is bad because when done to anyone with any of the three previous reasons being true, then it justifies the act to anyone else with any of the three previous reasons being true. The killing of anyone with any of the three previous reasons being true, is wrong, and thus it is wrong to justify a wrong.

Using logical thinking, I have stated the four reasons why murder is bad. As you can see, none of them apply to a fetus.",Abortion is Murder,for,"[3, 11]"

Abortion is yes, the killing of an unborn child, BUT look from the standpoint of the one that has to get one. For one, your words don't help. Two, they usually don't have the abortion because they want to get rid of the child, but because they can't afford the child, are not mature enough, or because they are scared. It costs more to have a child and put it up for adoption than it does to get the abortion (abortion is only $300-950 depending on how far along the patient is). Also, mothers have abortions to let the child die more peacefully than to let them live with a crippling disease that will put them through more pain, and also the fact that they may know the child is going to die very young because of something. Instead of making the child deal with that pain for 2+ years, it's better to let them go when they do. This project I did changed my perspective on abortion.

Their carelessness has resulted in ending a unique life, Which had its own unique DNA as well as unique genetic traits and unique cells. Just because you had forgot your condom you had to bare a baby and now you want to take the easy way out? No way mate. We should take responsibility in taking care of ourselves and making decisions that will not result in the death of an unborn baby. Simply put, If you don't want a baby, Wear protection. 

However, There are unique cases that blur the line here. Cases of rape, Mental or physical retardation of the fetus and endangerment to the mother's health have all been raised as reasons for abortions to take place. It hard to understand such trauma of mothers bearing a child that is 'less than perfect' or the result of being raped. Yet, While we tend to look at the burden of the mother, We do fail to take into account about the unborn child. Should a fetus or baby be responsible for the crimes of the father? If a fetus is detected to have some form of disability and will be aborted, Does that mean disabled people could also apply to such treatment? What about people in a coma? They can't survive without external help, Yet when it comes to an unborn child people said such decisions are viable because an unborn child cannot survive outside the womb, And thus applying to people who are in comatose or vegetative state. No matter how we draw a line on why a fetus should be aborted, It seems it still does in one way or another have an affect to other living beings that are present on this Earth. 

I personally don't know about my second paragraph, As I continue to question and debate myself over such reasons like rape or fetus retardation as mentioned in the second paragraph, But if based on my first paragraph then yes. If you were responsible for the creation of this child you will bare the responsibility of raising it.

I personally think it should never be legal. Yes, it's a woman's body, but it's also another human's body. If a grown person is able to be placed inside a woman's body, that doesn't mean that person has no rights and the woman can kill him/her. 

This is also about accepting responsibility. Yes, consent for sex is not consent for pregnancy. But driving drunk doesn't mean you consent to run over someone. There are many people who successfully drive drunk, but if you make a mistake, you're going to have to take responsibility. 

And it's not just the woman who needs to take the responsibility - the man made a mistake too. He should be legally required to financially provide for the woman while she is pregnant, unless she opts out. Then they can put the baby up for adoption and get on with their lives.

Also abortion can be extremely harmful to the mother. So the mother would be murdering her soon to be child and giving herself a chance of dying.",It's like murder!!!!!!,against,"[16, 30]"
2692,2692,1580744435-251,https://www.debate.org/opinions/do-women-have-the-right-to-abort-a-fetus,"No, We should not have the right to abort a fetus, That is murder. Before you say that a fetus is not alive, Yes it is, Get a life get out of your bubble of ignorance. I will always see arguments saying ""what if the family can't support the child"" or ""what if the child is born with a medical defect"" or some difficulty that the child may have, But is death better than living a slightly worse life than the rest of us? No, I don't have any birth defects nor was i born in a family in poverty but, I have friends that have birth defects and some that are in poverty but not only do they enjoy life, They enjoy it more than me. If you think letting your child should be killed rather than live a hard life, I can assure you that you have never worked hard towards something, If you believe that if you murder your child because they won't have a fair life due to their birth, Let me fill you in on how their life will most likely turn out. They will work harder, Due to their hardships in life and will be more successful than those who's parents gave them a perfect childhood, But if you believe in your child, And don't hand them everything in life, They will most likely be successful. This is more common in households on the lower end of the income spectrum, Parents can't afford to give their kids everything so kids will try to work hard towards it, This teaches kids how to pursue and make sure that if they fail, That there is always a different way. Like I said, I wasn't born into poverty, But when my dad died, My mom, (who makes $28000 a year) couldn't afford the lifestyle i had before my dad died (he earned $200000 a year). So after that I learned hard work and at the age of 13 got a job that taught me many skills like first aid (the job is woodworking at a local company), Woodworking and home repairs. If you choose to not abort your child due to them having a hard life, You are an idiot, Life is precious, No matter what hardships you or the child might face, Keep the child and trust me, You would be surprised how they could benefit. 

Oh BTW the overpopulation thing is bull s*** if we lived as compact as Manhattan, Every human could live in Texas, I've been to Manhattan and it's really not that dense, I believe humans could easily live in Texas if over population is a problem. I you believe in abortion is good in any other situation other than the mothers health, You are lazy, You just don't want to start a new life and are a selfish hypocrite who doesn't understand the needs for others. If you don't want a child, Don't take part in acts that could make one.",Is murder right?,against,"[22, 16, 24]"
